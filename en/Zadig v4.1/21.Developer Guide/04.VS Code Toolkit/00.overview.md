Zadig Toolkit is a Visual Studio Code extension for Zadig, a product under KodeRover.
This extension allows developers to access Zadig's core capabilities directly in their IDE without the hassle of platform switching, enabling easy viewing, service debugging and upgrades, restarting, and real-time log viewing of Kubernetes environments in Zadig projects.
During daily development, after code modifications, developers can hot-deploy services to Zadig cloud without committing to Git repositories or building images, facilitating service self-testing, integration testing, and validation.
Currently, Zadig Toolkit supports the following features:
- Zadig environment viewing
- Microservice restart, service image replacement, service detail viewing, Pod real-time log viewing, login to service instance Pod
- Remote debugging of local applications, configuring remote development environments

::: warning Version Compatibility
The Zadig Toolkit extension supports versions v1.12.0 - v1.16.0.

## How to Use
### Remote Debugging of Local Code

Below, using the prepared `voting-demo` project as an example, we'll introduce how to perform remote debugging through Zadig Toolkit.

- Select the `voting-demo` project -> `dev` environment, click the icon on the right side of the environment to set Kube Config (i.e., the config configuration file of the cluster where the dev environment is located), you can select this configuration file in the file directory or manually enter its path and press Enter.

![plugin-setting](../../../_images/kube_config_set.png)

- Select the `vote` service, click the debug button to enter development mode.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_1.png)

- Select the local development code directory, in this example it's [koderover/zadig](https://github.com/koderover/zadig) -> examples -> voting-app.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_2.png)
![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_3.png)

- Select the base image `python:3.10.4-buster` for the development environment.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_4.png)
![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_5.png)

- Wait a moment for the development mode to start and complete, then enter the development container `dev`, the content in the selected directory will be automatically synchronized to the development container.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_6.png)
![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_7.png)

- Modify local code and save: Change the background color of the first vote button.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_8.png)

- The modified code will be automatically synchronized to the remote `dev` development environment. In the terminal, enter the `vote` directory and execute the startup command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:80 --log-file - --access-logfile - --workers 4 --keep-alive 0
```

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_9.png)

- Access the vote service address, the modification result is shown in the figure below.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_10.png)

- Click the red button to confirm ending development mode, the container returns to normal.

![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_11.png)
![debug-service](../../../_images/debug_service_vote_12.png)

At this point, a complete local debugging process demonstration is finished.

### View Environment and Services

During daily integration testing, you need to diagnose services. Through Zadig Toolkit, you can view service status, restart services, replace service images, view real-time service logs, and login to the corresponding Pod of the service.

- Right-click on a service to view service details. In the service details page, you can view real-time service logs, and click the edit icon on the right side of the image to modify the service image.

![detail_env_info](../../../_images/detail_env_info_1.png)

- Right-click on a service, then click `Restart Service` to restart the service.

![detail_env_info](../../../_images/detail_env_info_2.png)

- Right-click on a service, click `Terminal` to login to the corresponding Pod of the service.

### Configure Remote Development Environment

- When you need to modify the base image of the development environment, or modify the synchronized local code directory, you can quickly set it by clicking the `Development Mode Configuration` button.

> Description of each field in the configuration:
``` json
[
  {
    "projectName": Project name,
    "envName": Environment name,
    "serviceName": Service name,
    "containerName": Development environment container name,
    "image": Development environment base image,
    "codeDir": Local directory synchronized to the development environment container
  }
]
```

![dev_env_config](../../../_images/dev_env_config_1.png)

- After saving the custom development mode configuration, click `Start Development Mode`, and it will quickly start development mode based on the information in the configuration file.
