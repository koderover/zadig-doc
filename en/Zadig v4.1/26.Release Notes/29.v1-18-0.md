## Business Change Notice

### Service Variable Changes

::: warning
To make K8s YAML service variable functionality more user-friendly, v1.18.0 deprecated the service variable visibility feature. If you are using service variables, please note the following before upgrading.
:::

1. If nested variables are used in service configuration, ensure multiple variables have consistent visibility. For example, in the following case, `ports_config[].protocol` and `ports_config[].container_port` need to have consistent visibility.

::: details
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: $T-Service$
        ports:
        {{- range .ports_config}}
          - protocol: {{.protocol}}
            containerPort: {{.containerPort}}
        {{- end}}
        ...more content omitted...
```
:::
2. For invisible service variables in service configuration, explicitly declare them in the environment's global variables.

> Service variable visibility configuration can be found in the documentation: [Variable Settings](/Zadig%20v1.17.0/project/service/k8s/#自定义变量).

:::

### Database Backup
If already in production use, **be sure** to backup the database before upgrading
1. Database backup commands:
- Backup MongoDB data
```bash
mongodump -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE -o FILE_PATH
```
- Backup MySQL data
```bash
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user > user.sql
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex > dex.sql
```
2. Database restore commands:
- Restore MongoDB data
```bash
mongorestore -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE --drop FILE_PATH
```
- Restore MySQL data
```bash
# Execute the following in MySQL:
mysql> drop database user;
mysql> create database user;
mysql> drop database dex;
mysql> create database dex;
# Execute the following data recovery operations from command line:
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user < user.sql
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex < dex.sql
```

### Upgrade Operations

> Please execute corresponding upgrade steps according to different installation methods.

#### Installation Method: [`All in One Installation Mode`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/all-in-one/) or [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)

For both installation methods, use the script from [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)<sup style='color: red'>New</sup> for upgrade.

#### Installation Method: [`Helm Command Installation`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/helm-deploy/)
For this installation method, execute the following steps to upgrade to v1.18.0:

1. Execute the following command to backup installation parameters and save as zadig.yaml file.

```bash
helm get values <Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace>  > zadig.yaml
```

2. Execute upgrade command according to installation method.

- Domain method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} --version=1.18.0
```

- IP + PORT method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>
export PORT=<Any port between 30000-32767, different from initially used port>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.httpNodePort=${PORT} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.type=NodePort --version=1.18.0
```

## [Optional] Post-Upgrade Operations

In the new version, the resource-server component is deprecated. The component in the koderover-agent namespace of connected clusters no longer performs actual Zadig-related work and can be manually deleted.
