### Upgrade Process for Existing K8s Cluster - High Availability Database
#### Step 1: Backup Data
For high availability databases, configure MongoDB full backup through cloud provider.
#### Step 2: Uninstall Zadig
1. Download [uninstall script](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Namespace where Zadig is located>
bash uninstall.sh
```
#### Step 3: Install Zadig v1.7.0
1. Download [installation script](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/tag/v1.7.0), execute the installation script.
```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=<ENCRYPTION_KEY obtained during first installation>
# Configure necessary parameters, refer to [Installation on Existing Kubernetes](/v1.7.1/install/install-on-k8s/)
./install.sh
```
2. Download [data synchronization tool](https://resources.koderover.com/dist/1.7.0-upgrade.yaml), execute upgrade Job.
