### Upgrade Process for Existing K8s Cluster - High Availability Database
#### Step 1: Backup Data
For high availability databases, configure MongoDB full backup through cloud provider.
#### Step 2: Uninstall Zadig
1. Download [uninstall script](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Namespace where Zadig is located>
bash uninstall.sh
```
#### Step 3: Install Zadig v1.7.0
1. Download [installation script](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/tag/v1.7.0), execute the installation script.
```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=<ENCRYPTION_KEY obtained during first installation>
# Configure necessary parameters, refer to [Installation on Existing Kubernetes](/v1.7.1/install/install-on-k8s/)
./install.sh
```
2. Download [data synchronization tool](https://resources.koderover.com/dist/1.7.0-upgrade.yaml), execute upgrade Job.
    1. Modify the last line script <span v-pre>`value: {{ default "http" .Values.protocol }}://{{- include "zadig.endpoint" . }}`</span> to the actual system access domain/IP
    2. Modify `mongodb://zadig-mongodb:27017` to the corresponding connection string
    3. Modify `zadig` in the line below `-d` to the corresponding dbname
    4. Execute the following command
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f 1.7.0-upgrade.yaml -n <Zadig namespace>
    ```
3. Ensure Job executes successfully

#### Step 4: Verify Installation Results
1. Version information confirmation
    1. Access `<Zadig address after installation>/signin`
    2. Check the info prompt in the bottom right corner of the login interface, Version information should be 1.7.0
2. New version correctness check, recommended validation points
    1. Administrator accesses any normally used project in the system
    2. Execute workflow to deploy and update services in specified environment
    3. Create integration environment, delete integration environment, update integration environment
    4. Submit code changes, confirm whether workflows with Webhook configured are triggered as expected

#### Failure Rollback Process
