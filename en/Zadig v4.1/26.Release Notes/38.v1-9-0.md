### Database Backup
If already in production use, **be sure** to backup the database before upgrading
1. Database backup commands:
- Backup MongoDB data
```bash
mongodump -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE -o FILE_PATH
```
- Backup MySQL data
```bash
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user > user.sql
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex > dex.sql
```
2. Database restore commands:
- Restore MongoDB data
```bash
mongorestore -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE --drop FILE_PATH
```
- Restore MySQL data
```bash
# Execute the following in MySQL:
mysql> drop database user;
mysql> create database user;
mysql> drop database dex;
mysql> create database dex;
# Execute the following data recovery operations from command line:
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user < user.sql
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex < dex.sql
```

### Upgrade Operations

> Please execute corresponding upgrade steps according to different installation methods.

#### Installation Method: [`All in One Installation Mode`](/v1.7.0/install/all-in-one/) or [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/v1.7.0/install/install-on-k8s/)

For both installation methods, use scripts from [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)<sup style='color: red'>New</sup> for upgrade, with the following considerations:

::: warning
- <font color=#FF000 >**Pay special attention to configuring ENCRYPTION_KEY, otherwise it will cause inability to access previous data after upgrade**</font>. For information on obtaining ENCRYPTION_KEY, refer to: [How to get ENCRYPTION_KEY](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/faq/debug-system/#安装时依赖的-encryption-key-信息遗忘-如何获取到).
- <font color=#FF000 >**If upgrading from v1.7.0/v1.7.1 to v1.9.0 and installed using IP + PORT method, please change the PORT parameter to specify a different port**</font> to avoid upgrade failure due to [port occupation](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/faq/debug-system/#使用-ip-port-的方式从-1-7-0-1-7-1-版本升级时报错-provided-port-is-already-allocated).
:::

#### Installation Method: [`Helm Command Installation`](/v1.7.0/install/helm-deploy/)
For this installation method, execute the following steps to upgrade to v1.9.0:

1. Execute the following command and check the zadig.yaml file. If the file contains image information (i.e., `tag:a.b.c`), it needs to be manually deleted.

```bash
helm get values <Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace>  > zadig.yaml
```

2. Execute upgrade command according to installation method.

- Domain method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} --version=1.9.0
```

- IP + PORT method:

::: warning
<font color=#FF000 >**If upgrading from v1.7.0/v1.7.1 to v1.9.0, please use a different port than when installing to upgrade v1.9.0**</font> to avoid upgrade failure due to [port occupation](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/faq/debug-system/#使用-ip-port-的方式从-1-7-0-1-7-1-版本升级时报错-provided-port-is-already-allocated).
:::

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>
export PORT=<Any port between 30000-32767, different from initially used port>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.httpNodePort=${PORT} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.type=NodePort --version=1.9.0
```

### (Optional) Post-Upgrade Operations

If upgrading from v1.7.0/v1.7.1 to v1.9.0 and external clusters were integrated in the Zadig system before upgrade, after upgrading to v1.9.0, you need to disconnect the external cluster connection and re-integrate it, otherwise the functionality of using that cluster for builds will be abnormal. For cluster integration, refer to: [Cluster Management](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/pages/cluster_manage/).
