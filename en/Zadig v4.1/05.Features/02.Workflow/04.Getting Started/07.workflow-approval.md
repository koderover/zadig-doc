This article introduces how to configure and use the approval feature of Zadig workflows.
- The workflow supports manual approval tasks. After approval is granted, the workflow will continue to run
- It supports multiple approvals, setting approval timeout, and configuring multiple approvals within a single workflow

Currently, the following four approval methods are supported:
- Zadig Approval: Approval operation in the Zadig system
- Feishu Approval: Approval operation in the Feishu application
- DingTalk Approval: Approval operation in the DingTalk application
- Enterprise WeChat Approval: Approval operation in the Enterprise WeChat application

## Zadig Approval

### How to Configure

Add a "Manual Approval" task to the workflow, select `Zadig` as the approval method.

Parameter Description:
- `Timeout`: Starting from the time the approval is triggered, if the timeout is exceeded, it is considered that the approval has failed due to timeout, and subsequent tasks will not be executed
- `Approver`: Select the Zadig user or user group to participate in the approval
- `Approval Required`: When the number of participants meets the value specified here, the entire approval process is considered complete
