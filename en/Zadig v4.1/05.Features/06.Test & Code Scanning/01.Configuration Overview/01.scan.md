- Supports code scanning for all programming languages
- Supports using SonarQube and custom tools within Zadig for code scanning
- Supports configuring quality gate checks based on SonarQube scan results
- Supports one-click navigation to the Sonar system to analyze code scan results
- Supports code scanning for multiple code repositories
- Supports automatically triggering code scanning based on code changes
- Supports notifying the code scanning results to DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, and Feishu

## Create a New Code Scan

Go to the project → Code Scanning, click `Create` and fill in the configuration.

### Basic Information

- `Name`: The name of the code scan, no duplication is allowed under the same project
- `Scanner`: You can specify `SonarQube` or `Other`
- `Infrastructure`: Supports executing code scanning tasks on Kubernetes and hosts
- `Basic Image`: The specific runtime environment when executing the code scanning task
    - If you use the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, the system has a built-in environment `sonar` that supports this tool. Select `sonar`
    - If you use other tools for code scanning, you can refer to [Custom Image](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/settings/custom-image/) and add as needed
- `Packages`: When using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, you can configure this item to specify various software package tools needed during the scanning process, such as different versions of Java, Go, Node, etc
    - When selecting software packages, pay attention to the dependencies between multiple software packages and install them in the correct order. For example: Govendor depends on Go, so select Go first, then Govendor
    - The platform has some common software packages built-in. If you have other software packages or version requirements, the system administrator can configure the installation scripts in [Package Management](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/settings/app/)
- `Sonar Host`: This item must be configured when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning
    - You need to integrate Sonar into the system in advance. Refer to [Sonar Integration](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/settings/sonar/)
    - When the code scanning is completed, Zadig will upload the results to the specified system

### Code Information
Configure code information for code scanning. When the code scanning is executed, the code will be pulled according to the specified configuration. For supported code sources, refer to [Code Source Information](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list). For specific fields in the code information, refer to [Code information field description](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/project/build/#%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF).

### Variables

Includes system-built-in variables and user-defined variables, which can be used directly in the scanning scripts.

> Tip: Add `env` commands to [Scan script](#scan-script) to view all build variables.

**Built-in Variables**

The built-in variables and their descriptions are as follows:

|Variable Name|Description|
|-------|---|
|`SONAR_URL`|Sonar Server access address|
|`WORKSPACE`|The working directory of the current code scan|
|`PROJECT`|Project identifier|
|`TASK_ID`|The ID of the code scan task|
|`TASK_URL`|The URL of the code scan task|
|`CI`|The value is always true and can be used as needed, such as to determine whether it is a CI script or another script|
|`Zadig`|The value is always true and can be used as needed, such as to determine whether it is executed in the Zadig system|
|`REPONAME_<index>`|1. Get the name of the code repository at the specified `<index>`<br>2. `<index>` is the position of the code in the code scanning configuration, with an initial value of 0<br>3. In the following example, using `$REPO_0` in the build script will get the name of the first code repository `voting-app`|
|`REPO_<index>`|1. Get the name of the code repository at the specified `<index>` and automatically replace the hyphen `-` in the name with an underscore `_`<br>2. `<index>` is the position of the code in the code scanning configuration, with an initial value of 0<br>3. In the following example, using `$REPO_0` in the build script will get the converted name of the first code repository `voting_app`|
|`<REPO>_PR`|1. Get the Pull Request information specified for `<REPO>` during the code scanning process. Please replace `<REPO>` with the specific code base name when using it<br>2. When the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the Pull Request information for the `voting-app` repository, use `$voting_app_PR` or `eval PR=\${${REPO_0}_PR}`<br>4. If multiple PRs are specified during the build, such as PR IDs 1, 2, 3, the value of the variable will be `1,2,3`<br>5. When the code base is from the `other` code source, this variable is not supported|
|`<REPO>_BRANCH`|1. Get the branch information specified for `<REPO>` during the code scanning process. Please replace `<REPO>` with the specific code base name when using it<br>2. When the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the branch information for the `voting-app` repository, use `$voting_app_BRANCH` or `eval BRANCH=\${${REPO_0}_BRANCH}`|
|`<REPO>_PRE_MERGE_BRANCHES`|1. Pre-merge branches for multi-branch merge builds; `<REPO>` is the specific repository name and can be provided directly or together with the `$<REPO_INDEX>` variable<br>2. If `<REPO>` contains a hyphen `-`, replace it with an underscore `_`<br>3. For example, use `eval BRANCH=\${${REPO_0}_PRE_MERGE_BRANCHES}` to retrieve the pre-merge branch information of the first repository|
|`<REPO>_TAG`|1. Get the Tag information specified for `<REPO>` during the code scanning process. Please replace `<REPO>` with the specific code base name when using it<br>2. When the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the Tag information for the `voting-app` repository, use `$voting_app_TAG` or `eval TAG=\${${REPO_0}_TAG}`|
|`<REPO>_COMMIT_ID`|1. Get the Commit ID information specified for `<REPO>` during the code scanning process. Please replace `<REPO>` with the specific code base name when using it<br>2. When the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the Commit ID information for the `voting-app` repository, use `$voting_app_COMMIT_ID` or `eval COMMIT_ID=\${${REPO_0}_COMMIT_ID}`<br>4. When the code base is from the `other` code source, this variable is not supported|
|`<REPO>_ORG`|1. Get the organization/user information specified for `<REPO>` during the code scanning process. Please replace `<REPO>` with the specific code base name when using it<br>2. When the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the organization/user information for the `voting-app` repository, use `$voting_app_ORG` or `eval ORG=\${${REPO_0}_ORG}`|

**Custom Variables**

Explanation:

- Supports string (single-line/multi-line), single-choice, multiple-choice, and file type variables
- You can set string type variables as sensitive information, and the value of sensitive variables will not be output in the scan log

### Scan Script
Configure the scan script as needed to scan the code.
![Pre-script configuration](../../../../_images/sonar_prescript_config.png)

### SonarScanner Scan

In `Add Steps`, you can configure SonarScanner Scan. `sonar.host.url` and `sonar.login` do not need to be configured, as the system will automatically inject them when performing a code scan. For more parameter configurations, refer to the [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/).

![Code scanning configuration](../../../../_images/sonar_parameter_config.png)

### Advanced Configuration

![Code scanning configuration](../../../../_images/scan_advanced_config_320.png)

Explanation:
- `Quality Gate`: Refer to [Quality gate check](#quality-gate-check)
- `Report Export`: Configure the scan report path
- `Timeout`: If the scan does not complete within the set time threshold, it will be considered a timeout failure
- `Cache`: After enabling the cache, the cache directory configured here will be used when the code scan is executed
- `Cluster`: Select the cluster resource used when the code scan task runs. The local cluster refers to the cluster where the Zadig system is located. Refer to [Cluster Management](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/pages/cluster_manage/) to integrate more cluster resources
- `Resources`: Configure resource specifications for executing code scanning tasks. The platform provides four configurations for High/Medium/Low/Lowest. In addition, you can also customize according to actual needs. If you need to use GPU resource, resource configuration form is `vendorname.com/gpu:num`, refer to [Scheduling GPU](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/) for more information
- `Scheduling`: Select the cluster scheduling policy, use `Random Scheduling` policy by default. Refer to [Set scheduling policy](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/pages/cluster_manage/#%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E8%B0%83%E5%BA%A6%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5) 
- `Output Variables`: Output variables from the code scan to enable variable passing between different tasks in the workflow, refer to [Variable Passing](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/project/common-workflow/#variable-passing)
- `Triggers and Notifications`: Configure Webhook Event, automatically trigger code scanning task execution, configuration details refer to [Triggers and notifications](#triggers-and-notifications)

### Triggers and Notifications

#### Triggers

> Refer to supported code source: [Code Source Information](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list)

![Code scanning configuration](../../../../_images/scan_webhook_config_330.png)

Parameter Description:

- `Repository`: That is, the code library in [Code information](#code-information) configuration
- `Target Branch`: The branch that listens to the code change event
- `Trigger Event`: Specify the Webhook event that triggers the code scan to run. The available events are as follows:
    - `Push commits` event (Merge operation) triggered
    - `Pull requests` Triggered when submitting a pull request
    - `Push tags` Triggered after creating a tag
- `Auto Cancel`: If checked, when multiple Webhook events trigger code scanning tasks in sequence, the system will automatically cancel the task in the queue
- `File Directory`: When the specified file or directory changes (new/modify/delete), a code scan is triggered, using the following code repository file structure example:

```bash
├── reponame  # Repository name
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── Makefile
  ├── README.md
  ├── src
    ├── service1/
    ├── service2/
    └── service3/
```

| Trigger Scenario | File Directory Configuration |
|----|------------|
| All file updates|`/`|
| All file updates except *.md|`/`<br>`!.md`|
| All file updates except those in the service1 directory | `/`<br>`!src/service1/`|
| All file updates in the service1 directory | `src/service1/` |
| File updates in the src directory (except those in the service1 directory)|`src`<br>`!src/service1/`|

#### Notification

Supports notifying the code scanning execution results to DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, Feishu Platform, email, and Webhook. For configuration, refer to [Notification](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/workflow/im/).

## Quality Gate Check

> Supported when the scan tool is SonarQube.

In the advanced configuration, enable the quality gate check. After enabling, Zadig will obtain the quality gate rules from SonarQube. If the quality gate fails, the task status will be set to failed. It will also return the specific rules and rule judgment results

![Quality gate result](../../../../_images/sonar_gateway_result.png)

To set rules, go to the SonarQube system and modify or add the Quality Gate configuration.

![Quality gate modification](../../../../_images/sonar_config.png)

## Execute Code Scanning

Select the specific code scan → Click `Run` to scan the code in the specified branch or tag.

![Execute code scanning](../../../../_images/run_scan_task.png)

When the code scanning task is completed, you can click the link to quickly jump to the SonarQube system to view the results.

> This feature is supported when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning.
