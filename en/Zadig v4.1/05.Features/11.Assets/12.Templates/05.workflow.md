The workflow template enables users to design multiple processes covering development, testing, and production release based on specific project needs, thereby standardizing and streamlining the project delivery process.

## New Template
### Create in the Template Library
Go to `Assets` → `Templates` → `Workflow` in sequence, click `+Workflow Template`, fill in the template name and content, and save it.
> The workflow template name must be unique throughout the system.

The enterprise templates are those created by users. Additionally, the system provides a large number of built-in templates that can be selected based on actual needs to achieve rapid workflow configuration.
