## Usage Scenarios

### Automatically Change Issues Through Workflows

### Automatically Trigger Workflows with Jira Events

After configuring the Jira trigger in the workflow, the Zadig workflow can be automatically triggered when a Jira Issue changes. After the workflow execution is complete, the execution information will be commented on the corresponding Issue, enabling two-way tracking between Zadig and Jira. For specific configuration, reference: [Jira Trigger](/en/Zadig%20v4.1/project/workflow-trigger/#jira-trigger).
