Workflows have capabilities such as building, deploying, testing, production releases, project collaboration, configuration changes, data changes, and service monitoring. This article introduces how to configure and use the tasks corresponding to these capabilities.

## Build
### Build
![common_workflow_config](../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_3_320.png)

Parameter Description:
- `Task Name` : Supports lowercase English letters, numbers, or hyphens within 32 characters, and must start with a lowercase English letter; in the same workflow, the task name must be unique
- `Image Repository` : Select the image repository. After the build task is successfully executed, the built image (i.e., the built-in `$IMAGE` variable) will be pushed to the selected repository
- `Service Component` : Supports runtime input or specifying pre-tasks.
- `Component List` :
  - `Variable Configuration` : Configure the variable value in the build, see [variable assignment](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/common-workflow/#variable-assignment-method)
  - `Branch Configuration` : Select the code repository and specify the default branch and branch options. The specified branch will be used by default when executing the workflow
  - `Shared Storage Configuration` : See [shared storage](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/common-workflow/#shared-storage)

## Deployment
### Deploy
![common_workflow_config](../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_5_310.png)

Parameter Description:
- `Task Name` : Supports lowercase English letters, numbers, or hyphens within 32 characters, and must start with a lowercase English letter; in the same workflow, the task name must be unique
- `Environment` : Select the environment to be deployed, and see [variable assignment](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/common-workflow/#variable-assignment-method)
- `Service Component` : Supports two configuration methods: manual input or specifying pre-build tasks (the system will use the `$IMAGE` variable output from the build task to deploy the service)
- `Deployment Content` : Includes the following three options:
  - `Service Image` : Update the service image
  - `Service Variables` : Update the service variables. See the definition of variables: [Service variables](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/service/k8s/#variable-configuration)
    - Variable sources support runtime input and global variables/other task outputs
  - `Service Configuration` : Update the service configuration. See the service configuration source: [Service Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/service/k8s/#create-service)
- `Service Variables and Configuration` : When `Deployment Content` includes `Service Variables`, configure the services and variables that can be updated by the workflow
- `Status Detection` : If enabled, the deployment task will poll the service operation status
  - If the service instance's Replicas = AvailableReplicas, the deployment is successful, and the workflow task status is successful
  - If the service container is in a waiting state due to ImagePullBackOff/ErrImagePull/CrashLoopBackOff/ErrImageNeverPull, it is considered a deployment failure, and the workflow task status is a failure
  - When the deployment timeout time is exceeded, the success is not met / Failure condition, the deployment timeout is exceeded. The deployment timeout setting can see [service policy configuration](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/project/service/k8s/#policy-configuration)

::: tip
- When the service component of the deployment task is specified as `Global Variables/Other Task Outputs`, the system will use the `$IMAGE` variable output from the build task to deploy the service.
- When deploying using a version, the phase is not executed concurrently, and the deployment tasks are deployed in the order of service orchestration.
- When deploying using a version, if the deployment task is configured with only `Service Image`, it supports automatically filtering out services that do not exist in the environment.

## Test
### Test

If the code repository of the test task is consistent with the selected task, then when executing the workflow, you only need to select service components and code information in the pre-task, and the test task will automatically reference the corresponding input.

After selecting the specific test configuration, you can set the default branches and variables of the code repository in the test configuration, and enable shared storage as needed. Refer to the document:

### Offline Service
> Supported in K8s YAML projects and K8s Helm Chart projects.

Remove the service from the environment.

::: tip
If the service is added to the environment through deployment, the offline service will delete the service resources from the K8s cluster; if the service is added to the environment through import-only, the resources of the service in the K8s cluster will still exist after the offline service.
