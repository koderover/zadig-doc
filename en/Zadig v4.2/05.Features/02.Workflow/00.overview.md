This article introduces the basic concepts of Zadig workflows. Zadig workflows support flexible orchestration of workflow processes, custom execution steps, and also possess capabilities such as configuration changes, data changes, and grayscale releases.

## Basic Concepts

Workflows consist of `stages` and `tasks`:
- Stage: Logically group the tasks of the workflow, such as the build stage, the deployment stage... Multiple stages run in series, and one stage can include multiple tasks.
- Task: An independent and complete operation, such as building, deploying, testing, custom tasks... Multiple tasks can be executed serially or concurrently. Tasks are divided into two types:
    - Custom tasks: Interact with third-party systems through the development of custom tasks. For specific development methods, see [Workflow tasks](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/settings/custom-task/)
    - Official tasks: Zadig officially provides tasks that can meet complex needs for building, deploying, testing, and releasing. The specific task types are as follows:

## Notification

Workflows support notifications to Feishu, Enterprise WeChat, and DingTalk groups. For specific configuration and usage, see [Workflow Notifications](/en/Zadig%20v4.2/workflow/im/)

## Workflow View

> Organize workflows in different views for quick preview and use.

Enter the project -> workflow, click the View tab to view the workflow information in the current view, and click the `+` button to create a new view.

- Only system administrators and project administrators can perform `Create View`, `Edit View`, and `Delete View` operations
- The `All` view contains all workflows under the current project and cannot be deleted
- After creating a new workflow in a view, the workflow will automatically belong to the current view
