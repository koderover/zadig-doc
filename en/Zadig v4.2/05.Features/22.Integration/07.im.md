This article introduces IM application integration in the Zadig system, using IM capabilities for notifications and approvals. Currently supports Feishu, DingTalk, and WeChat Work integration.

## Feishu

> Used for "Manual Approval" and "Notification" tasks in workflows.

Follow these steps to configure Feishu notifications and approvals:
1. Create and publish an application on the Feishu Developer Platform
2. Configure application credentials in Zadig to obtain the `Request Address` for event message push
3. Configure the `Request Address` on the Feishu Developer Platform

### Step 1: Create a Feishu App
1. Visit [the Feishu Developer Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) and create an "enterprise self-built application" as shown below.
