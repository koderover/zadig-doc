This article describes how to integrate an image repository on the Zadig system. Zadig supports integrating standard image repositories provided by cloud vendors or self-built image repositories, as well as mainstream image repository management platforms such as Harbor, DockerHub, Jfrog, Nexus, etc. The image repository is primarily used to store the images generated from builds and pre-release images, which are involved in the execution of workflows and the startup of environments.

## Add a Image Registry

Click `Assets` → `Image Registry` → `Add` and select the corresponding provider as needed

![reg](../../../../_images/reg_add_v180.png)

Parameter Description:

- `Default Use`: If set to `Default Use`, the image repository will be used by default when creating a new environment
- `Provider`: Supports Alibaba Cloud ACR, Huawei Cloud SWR, Tencent Cloud TCR, Harbor, DockerHub, Amazon ECR, and other Registry standard integrations
- `Specify Project Scope`: Specifies which projects can use the image repository. `All Projects` includes all projects created after the image repository is added

Advanced Configuration:

- `Enable SSL Verification`: Can disable SSL verification. After disabling, the system will inject the image address into `insecure-registry`.
- `TLS Certificate Content (Public Key)`: If the image repository is configured with a self-signed TLS/SSL certificate, the certificate public key content must be configured to function properly.

::: warning Modify <font color=#FF000 >Enable SSL Verification</font> and <font color=#FF000 >TLS Certificate Content (Public Key)</font> configuration
1. Modifying the configuration will cause the Zadig service to restart, which may affect the execution of workflows. Therefore, it is recommended to configure this when no workflows are running.
2. After modifying the configuration, if the cross-cluster build feature is used and the cluster is directly connected, the configuration will take effect only after the cluster components are updated.

## Using a image registry

**Workflow - Build**

When the workflow performs a build step, it pushes the build artifact to the specified image registry.

**Other Registry**

When the workflow performs a deployment step, it pulls the image from the specified image registry.

**Workflow - Image Distribution**

When the workflow performs an image distribution step, it pushes the artifact to the selected image registry in the workflow distribution configuration.

**Environment - Image Update**

In the environment, when updating a service image, it pulls the image from the specified image registry.
