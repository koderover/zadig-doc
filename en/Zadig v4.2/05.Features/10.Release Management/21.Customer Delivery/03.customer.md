## Install the Customer Console
### Installation Requirements

### Execute the Installation Script
The actual installation script is obtained from the vendor, for example:

``` bash
curl -sS http://a.b.com/api/plutus/customer/installer/install_plutus_customer.sh | bash
```
The specific execution process is as follows:

As shown in the above figure, the installation process requires the following information:
1. Enter the Namespace for the console installation
2. Access method: IP+Port or Domain
    1. If you choose IP+Port, enter the specific IP and Port information
    2. If you choose Domain, enter the specific Domain information

After a successful installation, the access address and console password can be obtained from the script output.

 The console does not currently support password modification, so the password must be saved to avoid loss.
