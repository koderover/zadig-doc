## Upgrade Process

::: warning
If MongoDB is deployed in Replica Set mode, please ensure that system databases such as admin/local/config/test are not used as Zadig business databases; if used, please migrate the data manually first.
If the current system version is < v3.4.0, please upgrade to v3.4.0 first. For the specific upgrade process, refer to [v3.4.0 Upgrade Method](/cn/Zadig%20v3.4/release-notes/v3.4.0/#版本升级过程), and then upgrade to v3.4.1 as follows.
:::

Please follow the corresponding upgrade process according to your installation method:

- Script command installation: Refer to the [documentation](/cn/Zadig%20v3.4/install/helm-deploy/#升级) for upgrade
- Helm command installation: Refer to the [documentation](/cn/Zadig%20v3.4/install/helm-deploy/#升级) for upgrade
- Official channel installation: Refer to the [documentation](/cn/Zadig%20v3.4/stable/install/#升级) for upgrade

## Upgrade Notes

During the upgrade, you need to adjust the image configuration in the saved Zadig values.yaml. Except for the dex component, the `image.repository` field for all images should remove the image registry prefix and only keep the image name.

For example:

```
# Before upgrade (needs modification)
image:
  repository: koderover.tencentcloudcr.com/koderover-public/cron

# After upgrade (correct format)
image:
  repository: cron
```
