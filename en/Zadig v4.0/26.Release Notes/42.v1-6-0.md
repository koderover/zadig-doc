    2. Database restore command: mongorestore -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE --drop FILE_PATH
2. If current system version < v1.3.1, please first upgrade to v1.3.1. For specific upgrade process, see [v1.3.1 Upgrade Method](/v1.6.0/release-notes/v1.3.1/), then follow the method below to upgrade to v1.6.0
:::

1. If installed using [`All in One Installation Mode`](/v1.6.0/install/all-in-one/) and [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/v1.6.0/install/install-on-k8s/), both use scripts from [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/v1.6.0/install/install-on-k8s/) for upgrade. You need to re-export parameters before executing upgrade scripts.

2. If installed using [`Helm Command Installation`](/v1.6.0/install/helm-deploy/), execute the following steps to upgrade to v1.6.0:
    
    1. Get helm values from zadig environment by executing the following command.

    ```
    helm get values zadig -n zadig > zadig.yaml
    ```

    Check the zadig.yaml file. If the yaml contains image information, it needs to be manually deleted.
    
    2. Execute the following command to upgrade.
    
    ```
    helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml zadig koderover-chart/zadig --namespace zadig --version=1.6.0
