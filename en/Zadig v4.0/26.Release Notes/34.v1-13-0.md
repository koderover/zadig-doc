mongodump -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE -o FILE_PATH
```
- Backup MySQL data
```bash
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user > user.sql

mysql> create database user;
mysql> drop database dex;
mysql> create database dex;
# Execute the following data recovery operations from command line:
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user < user.sql

```

### Upgrade Operations

> Please execute corresponding upgrade steps according to different installation methods.

#### Installation Method: [`All in One Installation Mode`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/all-in-one/) or [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)

For both installation methods, use scripts from [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)<sup style='color: red'>New</sup> for upgrade.

#### Installation Method: [`Helm Command Installation`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/helm-deploy/)

1. Execute the following command and check the zadig.yaml file. If the file contains image information (i.e., `tag:a.b.c`), it needs to be manually deleted.

```bash
helm get values <Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace>  > zadig.yaml
```

2. Execute upgrade command according to installation method.

- Domain method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} --version=1.13.0
```

- IP + PORT method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>
export PORT=<Any port between 30000-32767, different from initially used port>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.httpNodePort=${PORT} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.type=NodePort --version=1.13.0
```

::: warning Post-Upgrade Considerations
