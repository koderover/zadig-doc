## Business Change Statement
::: warning Task Cloning Logic Change

Zadig v3.2.0 version updates the workflow cloning task feature. If the workflow configuration changes, cloning of old tasks is no longer allowed to avoid the occurrence of cloning new processes by cloning tasks after the workflow configuration changes.

> After upgrading v3.2.0, cloning is no longer supported by old tasks. The cloning function of the new task is not affected and can be used normally.
:::

:::danger Database Version Upgrade
The built-in MongoDB version of Zadig v3.2.0 Chart has been upgraded. If you have used a built-in database before, to prevent data loss, it is recommended to replace it with an external database (MongoDB version 4.4+) before upgrading, or take measures to ensure data security on your own.

If the MongoDB is deployed in Replica Set mode, please make sure that the system libraries such as admin/local/config/test are not used as Zadig's business library; if it is used, please manually migrate the data first.
