## Overview

Zadig platform offers extensive openness and extensibility, supporting integration with almost all toolchains. It features deep integration with mainstream tools and platforms, providing a user-friendly developer interface. Additionally, Zadig provides secondary development capabilities for efficient integration with enterprise-built systems, helping enterprises transition from fragmented R&D management to platform engineering.

## Product Management Access

**Access Assessment**

Enterprises typically have existing CMDBs and portal centers to manage products and services. These can be linked to enterprise internal master data via OpenAPI. In Zadig, a project is the core business management unit, corresponding to internal systems or independent products/sub-business lines. The "services" in Zadig correspond to internal applications or micro-applications.
