This article describes how to use custom tasks in Zadig system to achieve openness of workflows. The following content includes: How to implement custom tasks and how to use custom tasks.

## Implement Custom Tasks

Encoding implements custom workflow tasks and puts the code and configuration into the library. The following is a description of the print `Hello Zadig` tasks as an example.

> Please refer to the documentation for supported code sources: [Code Source Information](/en/Zadig%20v4.0/settings/codehost/overview/) .

**Step 1** : Encoding and implementing the logic of custom tasks and saving them. The source code of this example main.go The content is as follows:
``` go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/spf13/viper"
)

const (
	WhoAmI        = "WHO_AM_I"
	WeatherStatus = "WEATHER_STATUS"
)

func main() {
    viper.AutomaticEnv()

    who_am_i := viper.GetString(WhoAmI)
    weather_status := viper.GetString(WeatherStatus)
    fmt.Printf("Hello %s, today is %s", who_am_i, weather_status)
}
```
**Step 2** : Compile the source code, build a mirror and go to the image registry push The relevant commands and Dockerfile references are as follows:
> Compile source code commands
``` bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -v -o greeting-bot main.go
```
> Dockerfile content:
``` dockerfile
FROM alpine/git:v2.30.2

# https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_the_timezone
RUN sed -i 's/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/mirrors.aliyun.com/g' /etc/apk/repositories && apk add tzdata && \
    cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime && \
    echo Asia/Shanghai  > /etc/timezone && apk del tzdata

WORKDIR /app
ADD greeting-bot .
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/greeting-bot"]
```
> Mirror construction and push command:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile --tag koderover.tencentcloudcr.com/koderover-public/greeting-bot:amd64
docker push koderover.tencentcloudcr.com/koderover-public/greeting-bot:amd64
```
**Step 3** : Write a task configuration file in the YAML format and submit the YAML file to the code base. The YAML configuration file `greeting-bot.yaml` of this example is as follows:
``` yaml
name: "Print Hello Zadig"           # Task name
category: "build"                   # Task type
version: "v0.0.1"                   # Task version
description: "Print Hello Zadig"           # Task description
image: koderover.tencentcloudcr.com/koderover-public/greeting-bot:amd64 # The image built in the previous step

inputs:                             # Variables that can be filled in Zadig
  - name: who_am_i                  # Variable name
    description: "who am i"         # Variable description
    type: string                    # Variable type, supports string (single-line text), text (multi-line text) and choice (single-choice)
    default: "Zadig"                # Variable default value
  - name: weather_status
    description: "what's the weather like today"
    type: choice                    # choice variable type
    choice_option:                  # choice variable type optional value
    - "sunny"
    - "cloudy"
    - "rainy"
    default: "sunny"               # choice variable type default value

envs:                               # Environment variables, automatically injected as environment variables when the above image container starts, in addition to envs, cmds and args are also supported
  - name: WHO_AM
    value: $(inputs.who_am_i)       # Environment variable value, using $(inputs.who_am_i) form to represent the input in Zadig
  - name: WEATHER_STATUS
    value: $(inputs.weather_status)

```

> The directory structure organization in the code base meets the following forms:
``` bash
path/to/your/repo                # Code repository root directory
├── greeting-bot                 # Task directory, when there are multiple tasks, they are organized in separate directories
│   └── v0.0.1                   # Version number
│       └── greeting-bot.yaml    # Task YAML file, the file name and task directory name are kept the same
```
At this point, a complete custom workflow task has been developed, and let’s look at how to use the task.

## Using Custom Tasks
Before using tasks, you need to integrate the code source and image registry in the system and configure the source of workflow tasks:
1. Refer to [the code source integration](/en/Zadig%20v4.0/settings/codehost/overview/) to integrate the above code library in Zadig
2. Refer to [the image registry integration](/en/Zadig%20v4.0/settings/image-registry/) , the image registry corresponding to the image is integrated in Zadig
3. The system administrator accesses `System Settings` -> `Plugins` , configures the code repository, branch and other information and saves it (i.e.: the code repository and branch where the YAML configuration file is located).

> If the integration source is successful and the task implementation in the code base is changed, just click `Sync` .

After the configuration is complete, add tasks to the workflow, select tasks and save the workflow. For more advanced functions, please refer to [the workflow](/en/Zadig%20v4.0/project/common-workflow/) .

## Task Configuration YAML Syntax
### Basic Information

For example:
```yaml
name: "Print Hello Zadig"
category: "build"
version: "v0.0.1"
description: "Print Hello Zadig"
image: koderover.tencentcloudcr.com/koderover-public/greeting-bot:amd64
```

Parameter Description:
- `name` : Task name, as shown in the figure below.
- `category` : Task type, including build (Build), deploy (Deployment), test (Test), project-manager (Project Management), config-change (Configuration Change), data-change (Data Change), release (Publish Policy). Other fields can be entered in double quotes: `"This is a custom field"`
- `version` : The version number of the task
- `description` : Task description information, as shown in the figure below
- `image` : The mirror address of the task

![pipeline_task](../../../_images/pipeline_task_syntax_0.png)

### inputs

inputs is used to define the value of the variable that can be passed into the container when configuring the workflow.

For example:
```yaml
inputs:
  - name: who_am_i
    description: "who am i"
    type: string
    default: "Zadig"
  - name: weather_status
    description: "what's the weather like today"
    type: choice
    choice_option:
    - "sunny"
    - "cloudy"
    - "rainy"
    default: "sunny"
```

Parameter Description:
- `name` : Variable name
- `description` : Description information
- `type` : three types: variable type: string (single-line text), text (multi-line text) and choice (single-choice)
- `choice_option` : When type is type choice , optional variable value
- `default` : Variable default value

The corresponding relationship between parameters and system fields is shown in the figure below

![pipeline_task](../../../_images/pipeline_task_syntax_1.png)

### envs

The variable information entered when executing a workflow can be passed into the container through envs. When the task container starts, the content configured in envs is automatically injected.

For example:
```yaml
envs:
  - name: WHO_AM_I
    value: $(inputs.who_am_i)
  - name: WEATHER_STATUS
    value: $(inputs.weather_status)
```
Parameter Description:
- `name` : Environment variable name
- `value` : Environment variable value, use $ ( inputs.who_am_i ) form to represent the input in Zadig

### cmds and args

If you need to modify the startup command of the container, you can configure the cmds and args parameters.

Give an example
```yaml
cmds:
- "/bin/sh"
- "-c"
args:
- "echo $(inputs.CONTENT)" # Configuration content supports use $ ( inputs.who_am_i ) Formal parameters
```
## More Demo

The following custom tasks are built-in to be used directly:

- `Jira Issue Status Change` Zadig Combine the workflow stage to change the Jira Issue status and connect with project management. The source code is located in [jira-updater](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/tree/release-1.14.0/pkg/microservice/aslan/core/workflow/service/workflow/plugins/jira-updater) .
- `Execute Jenkins Job` : Pass in Jenkins build parameters, trigger the specified Jenkins Job execution, the source code is located in [jenkins-runner](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/tree/release-1.14.0/pkg/microservice/aslan/core/workflow/service/workflow/plugins/jenkins-runner) .
- `MySQL Database Change` : Execute SQL statement for the MySQL database to realize the linkage change of data and code changes, and the source code is located in [mysql-runner](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/tree/release-1.14.0/pkg/microservice/aslan/core/workflow/service/workflow/plugins/mysql-runner) .

In addition, a workflow task shared code base is also opened: [koderover/zadig-jobs](https://github.com/koderover/zadig-jobs) , which contains several demo implementations and scenario descriptions for developers to use and refer to.
