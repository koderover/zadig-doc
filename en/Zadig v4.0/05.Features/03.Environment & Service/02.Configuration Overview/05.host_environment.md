Parameter Explanation:

- `Environment Name`: Enter the environment name
- `K8s Cluster`: The Kubernetes cluster where the service to be hosted is located. Note: This cluster must be integrated into Zadig in advance. For details, refer to [Cluster Management](/en/Zadig%20v4.0/pages/cluster_manage)
- `K8s Namespace`: The Kubernetes namespace where the service to be hosted is located
- `Select Service`: The service to be hosted

## View the environment

Click on a different environment Tab You can view the details of the hosted services in this environment. Click `Resource View` to view the resources under the namespace hosted by this environment from the perspective of workload / / storage / configuration and other resource.

### Basic Information
This includes information such as the K8s cluster, K8s namespace, update time, and environment status. The environment status can be one of the following:
- `Creating`: Creating.
- `Running`: All services in the environment are in the Running state.
- `Unstable`: Some services in the environment are in the Unstable state. There are two possible scenarios:
	- The container service has encountered an issue.
	- The container service is undergoing an update operation, such as updating the image, which may cause a temporary Unstable state. Once the update process is complete, the service status will return to Running.

### Service List

The service list displays all the hosted services in the current environment. The parameters are as follows:

- `Status`: The running status of the service
- `Image Information`: The current image being used by the service. You can click on the service name to modify it on the service details page
- `Service Entry`: If the service has Ingress information, it will be displayed
- `Operation`: Quickly restart the service

### Change Record
Click the icon in the upper right corner to view the operation log of the environment.
