This article primarily explains how to use Zadig's release plan feature, including planning, approval, and execution of release plans, as well as tracking detailed operation records.

## Planning
Access Management -> Release Plan: Create a new release plan, fill in the details, and save it as a draft. This feature supports multi-person collaboration for planning the release.

## Approval

> This applies to scenarios where the release plan includes approval configuration.

After the release owner submits the approval, the approver is responsible for the approval. Only after the approval is granted can the release owner proceed with the release.

::: tip
If the approval is rejected, the release plan content can be edited again and the release plan can be re-planned.
