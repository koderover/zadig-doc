This article primarily guides enterprises that have purchased Zadig products and services on how to use the official operation and maintenance tools to install and upgrade Zadig. It is recommended to contact the official team for corresponding support.
This tool helps enterprises to implement Zadig conveniently, supporting remote upgrades, rollbacks, and issue diagnosis. The following are the resource preparations and detailed steps for using the operation and maintenance tools to install Zadig.


## Resource Preparation

1. Kubernetes Cluster, version: v1.16 ~ v1.30, node recommendation: 2 units 8C16G, and administrator operation permissions for this cluster
2. A machine that can connect to the above-mentioned K8s cluster normally and has the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) client installed to execute the installation command
3. Network:
    - If you choose to access the Zadig system via IP+port, you need to ensure that the cluster nodes have external IPs for access
    - If you choose to access the Zadig system via domain name, you need to prepare an available domain name
4. Database:
    - Highly available MongoDB (version: v4.4+)
    - Highly available MySQL (version: v5.7+)

::: tip Reminder
1. Due to the network plugins and configurations of some cluster types, the backend Pod of a Service may not be able to access itself through the Service. Please ensure that this issue does not exist in the cluster before installation
2. Configure the kube-dns service to support name-based addressing between services and Pods

## Install Official Operation and Maintenance Tools

### Installation Preparation
- A machine that can connect to the K8s cluster normally is needed to execute the installation command
- Ensure that the machine has the kubectl client installed and can operate the K8s cluster with administrator permissions

### Perform the Installation

Run the following command to install the customer console:

```bash
curl -sS https://admin.8slan.com/api/plutus/customer/installer/install_plutus_customer.sh | bash
```

Installation successful output:

```bash
...
plutus customer installation complete
visit {访问地址} to access plutus customer
use password: {密码} to login to plutus
plutus customer installation completed in 36 seconds
```

### Configure Authorization Credentials
:::tip
Immediately logging in after a successful installation might fail because the system is initializing. Please wait patiently if you encounter this situation.
:::

Log in to the customer console with the access address and password output from the successful installation and initialize it with the authorization credentials.

![Configure authorization credentials](../../../_images/install_customer_1.png)
![Configure authorization credentials](../../../_images/install_customer_2.png)

The authorization credentials are officially issued by Zadig.

### [🔥Recommended] Official Installation Support

By enabling the "Supplier Maintenance Configuration" option, Zadig can obtain some operational permissions of the client console and receive complete official installation assistance.

The "Supplier Maintenance Configuration" permission open configuration method is shown in the figure below:

![Configure authorization credentials](../../../_images/install_customer_211_3.png)

After checking the configuration, click Save.


## Install Zadig

### Step 1: Select a Version

Visit the customer console > `版本`, click `发现新版本` to get all versions of Zadig, select the version as needed, and click `部署` to enter the parameter configuration page.

::: tip
1. If you forget the console login password, you can retrieve it through the following command:<br>
    `kubectl get cm plutus-customer-config -n {控制台所在的命名空间} -o=jsonpath='{.data.PLUTUS_PASSWORD}'`

2. When accessing the console using `IP + 端口` mode, if you forget the specific port, you can view it through the following command:<br>
    `kubectl get svc plutus-customer-portal -n {控制台所在的命名空间}`

### Step 2: Configure Parameters

Click `部署` after setting the installation parameters.

> The installation process is affected by hardware configuration and network conditions. The time may be different in different environments. You can execute it kubectl -n {Zadig The Namespace} get pod query service status in which you are located. When the version status becomes `部署成功` , it means that the deployment is completed.

Configuration Options Description:

- `命名空间`: Select the namespace for installing Zadig
- `Release 名称`: Customizable
- `Helm values 文件`: Configure Zadig's related installation parameters
    - Supports manual input of YAML and specified key/value to configure
    - [Click me](#%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E5%8F%82%E6%95%B0%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E) to view the installation parameter description

### Step 3: Access the System

- You need to register a system administrator for the first time to log in to the system.

## Upgrade Zadig

::: warning
Do not upgrade across versions.
:::

### Step 1: Backup Data

- Please be sure to back up the data, refer to the document: [Backup data](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/stable/backup-and-restore/#%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%A4%87%E4%BB%BD) .
- Please back up the current installation parameters.
![Backup](../../../_images/upgrade_1.png)

### Step 2: Perform the Upgrade

Visit the customer console > `版本`, click `发现新版本` to get the new version of Zadig, and then click `部署` after selecting the new version.

![Install](../../../_images/install_1.png)

Fill in the backup installation parameters into `Helm values 文件` and deploy.

::: tip
Do not modify the namespace and Release names during the upgrade.
:::

![Install](../../../_images/install_2.png)

### Step 3: Verify the Upgrade

After the deployment is successful, clear the browser cache, log in to the Zadig system, and check whether the following functions are normal to accept this upgrade:

1. Check whether the account system can log in normally.
2. Check whether the data in the project/workflow/environment/service/build/system integration is normal.
3. Check whether the service instances in the environment are normal and whether the workflows can run normally.
4. Check the functions of daily high-frequency use.

## Rollback Zadig

::: warning
Please confirm that Zadig is in a shutdown state before rolling back. Do not use the Zadig system during the rollback process.
:::

### Step 1: Recover Data

Restore the backup data of the target version, refer to the document: [Data Import](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/stable/backup-and-restore/#%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%AF%BC%E5%85%A5) .

### Step 2: Perform Rollback

Visit the customer console > `版本`, select the target version you want to rollback and click `部署`.

![Install](../../../_images/rollback.png)

Configure `Helm values 文件` and fill in the backup installation parameters.

::: tip
Do not modify the namespace and Release names during the rollback.
:::

![Install](../../../_images/install_2.png)

### Step 3: Verify Rollback
After the deployment is successful, clear the browser cache, log in to the Zadig system, and check whether the following functions are normal to accept this rollback:

1. Check whether the account system can log in normally.
2. Check whether the data in the project/workflow/environment/service/build/system integration is normal.
3. Check whether the service instances in the environment are normal and whether the workflows can run normally.
4. Check the functions of daily high-frequency use.
