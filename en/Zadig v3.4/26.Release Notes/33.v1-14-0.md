### Upgrade Operations

> Please execute corresponding upgrade steps according to different installation methods.

#### Installation Method: [`All in One Installation Mode`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/all-in-one/) or [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)

```bash
helm get values <Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace>  > zadig.yaml
```

2. If you have previously modified the following values, please additionally modify the corresponding parameters
- microservice.user.database  =>   connections.mysql.db.user
- microservice.config.dexdatabase => connections.mysql.db.dex


3. Execute upgrade command according to installation method.

- Domain method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} --version=1.14.0
```

- IP + PORT method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>
export PORT=<Any port between 30000-32767, different from initially used port>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.httpNodePort=${PORT} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.type=NodePort --version=1.14.0
```
