## Version Upgrade Process
::: warning
If current system version < v1.9.0, please first upgrade to v1.9.0. For specific upgrade process, see [v1.9.0 Upgrade Method](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/release-notes/v1.9.0/#版本升级过程), then follow the method below to upgrade to v1.10.0

### Database Backup
If already in production use, **be sure** to backup the database before upgrading
1. Database backup commands:
- Backup MongoDB data
```bash
mongodump -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE -o FILE_PATH
```
- Backup MySQL data
```bash
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user > user.sql
mysqldump -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex > dex.sql
```
2. Database restore commands:
- Restore MongoDB data
```bash
mongorestore -h IP --port PORT -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DATABASE --drop FILE_PATH
```
- Restore MySQL data
```bash
# Execute the following in MySQL:
mysql> drop database user;
mysql> create database user;
mysql> drop database dex;
mysql> create database dex;
# Execute the following data recovery operations from command line:
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p user < user.sql
mysql -h <HOST> -P <PORT> -u root -p dex < dex.sql
```

### Upgrade Operations

> Please execute corresponding upgrade steps according to different installation methods.

#### Installation Method: [`All in One Installation Mode`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/all-in-one/) or [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)

For both installation methods, use scripts from [`Installation on Existing Kubernetes`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/install-on-k8s/)<sup style='color: red'>New</sup> for upgrade.

#### Installation Method: [`Helm Command Installation`](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/install/helm-deploy/)
For this installation method, execute the following steps to upgrade to v1.10.0:

1. Execute the following command and check the zadig.yaml file. If the file contains image information (i.e., `tag:a.b.c`), it needs to be manually deleted.

```bash
helm get values <Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace>  > zadig.yaml
```

2. Execute upgrade command according to installation method.

- Domain method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} --version=1.10.0
```

- IP + PORT method:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Zadig Installation NAMESPACE>
export PORT=<Any port between 30000-32767, different from initially used port>

helm repo update
helm upgrade -f zadig.yaml <release_name> koderover-chart/zadig --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.httpNodePort=${PORT} \
    --set gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.service.type=NodePort --version=1.10.0
```

::: warning Post-Upgrade Considerations

1. If upgrading from v1.9.0 to v1.10.0 and external clusters were integrated in the Zadig system before upgrade, after upgrading to v1.10.0, you need to disconnect the external cluster connection and re-integrate it, otherwise the functionality of using that cluster for builds will be abnormal. For cluster integration, refer to: [Cluster Management](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/pages/cluster_manage/).
2. If build cache was enabled in v1.9.0, you need to explicitly configure the use of **Object Storage** or **Cluster Storage** for the cluster where builds are located in **Cluster Management**. For build cache configuration, refer to: [Cache Resource Configuration](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/pages/cluster_manage/#缓存资源配置).
3. If using a custom account system, after upgrade you need to rebuild and deploy dex according to the [documentation](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/settings/account/custom/).
