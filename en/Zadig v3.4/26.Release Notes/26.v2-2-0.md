## Business Change Statement

1. The product workflow is offline, and the original product workflow data is automatically migrated to the custom workflow. Due to the change of the workflow engine, some functions have been adjusted, as follows:
    - Original product workflow Jenkins build function is offline, and will be supported in custom workflows in the future
    - Original product workflow webhook Update policy `动态选择空闲环境更新` and `设定指定环境为基准环境` functions in the trigger are offline, and subsequently supported in custom workflows
    - The original product workflow mirror rollback function is temporarily offline, and will be supported in custom workflows in the future.
    - If the environment is not specified in the original product workflow, an environment will be automatically selected to fill in after upgrading.
    - k8s yaml Project creation version and version release function changes, please refer to [the documentation](/0) for details
    - The system is built-in variable adjustment, and you can use custom workflow variable transfer capabilities to obtain corresponding variables by adjusting configuration and scripts.
        - Test
            - Downline variables: `LINKED_ENV` , `ENV_NAME` , `SERVICES`
            - Modify the change amount: `TEST_URL` to `TASK_URL`
        - Build
            - Downline variables: `DIST_DIR` , `ENV_NAME`
            - Modify the change amount: `BUILD_URL` to `TASK_URL`
    - The new workflow after migration is unified in view `所有`
::: warning
If the original product workflow itself cannot be executed normally, the workflow will not be automatically migrated to the custom workflow.
:::


2. The host access method is adjusted. In the v2.2.0 version, the same host only supports one access method. If SSH and agent are configured before upgrading, the system will automatically retain the SSH configuration after upgrading, and the Agent method needs to be re-connected after upgrading.
3. The host project deployment configuration adjustment is no longer supported and built steps shared workspace. If there are files in the deployment task using the build task workspace, the configuration needs to be adjusted after upgrading.


## Version Upgrade Process

::: danger
Due to the specificity of product workflow configuration and the risk of data upgrade failure, it is strongly recommended that product workflows be moved to custom workflows by themselves.
:::

::: warning
If you are using MongoDB Version > 4.0 and deployed in Replica Set mode, please confirm that the business library is not used admin/local/config/test supported to the system library Zadig ; if it is used, please manually migrate the data first.
If the current system version is available < v2.1.0 please upgrade to v2.1.0 first. For the specific upgrade process, please refer to [the v2.1.0 upgrade method](/Zadig%20v2.2.0/release-notes/v2.1.0/#%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7%E8%BF%87%E7%A8%8B) , and then upgrade to v2.2.0
