This article introduces the fundamental concepts of Zadig testing and code scanning.

## Test

Zadig Testing manages the execution process of automated testing, supporting unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and more. This module can be executed independently or directly integrated into the Zadig workflow, supporting cross-project operations.

For specific configuration, refer to [Test](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/test/).

## Code Scanning

The Zadig Code Scanning module supports Sonar and other scanning tools for static security scanning, code component analysis, dynamic security scanning, and more. This module can be executed independently or integrated into the Zadig workflow.

For specific configuration, refer to [Code Scanning](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/scan/).
