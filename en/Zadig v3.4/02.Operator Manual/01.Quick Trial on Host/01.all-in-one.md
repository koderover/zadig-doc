Install Kubernetes and Zadig on a single cloud host or virtual machine, suitable for users who are new to Kubernetes and Zadig and want to quickly experience the systems.

::: danger
The All in One installation method does not support version upgrades or high availability configurations and is not recommended for production use.
:::

## Step 1: Prepare a Linux Machine

::: warning
To avoid conflicts or other unknown errors that may cause installation failure, it is recommended to keep your operating system clean and avoid installing any software that could cause conflicts.
:::

### Hardware Requirements

|  Operating System                                               |  Recommended Configuration                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------|
| **Ubuntu** 16.04,18.04,20.04                           | CPU: 8 cores, Memory: 16 GB, Disk: 50 GB |
| **CentOS** 7.4,7.5,7.6,7.7,7.8,7.9,8.0,8.1,8.2,8.3     | CPU: 8 cores, Memory: 16 GB, Disk: 50 GB |

> Recommended configuration: 8C16G (Zadig itself consumes 4C8G and can support the concurrent execution of two workflow tasks)

### Network Requirements
- The server must have internet access

### Other Requirements
- Installation must be performed as the Root user; using `sudo` is not recommended
- Ensure that the server can use the `curl` command
- Ensure that the server's firewall configuration allows access to ports 30000 - 32767 for external access
::: tip
- If you log in to the machine via SSH, to prevent the script from timing out and disconnecting the SSH session, it is recommended to add `ServerAliveInterval 60` to the client's `~/.ssh/config` file
:::

## Step 2: Download the Installation Script

Depending on your network conditions, you can choose the appropriate Zadig installation script from the following sources and add executable permissions.

GitHub Source:

```bash
# Download the installation script and add executable permissions
curl -LO https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.0/all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh
chmod +x ./all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh
```

Official Download Source:

```bash
# Download the installation script and add executable permissions
curl -L https://download.koderover.com/install?type=all-in-one -o all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh
chmod +x ./all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh
```

::: tip Tips
The following table lists the environment variables supported by the installation script. The installation will use default values, but you can configure these variables before running the installation script if needed.
:::

```bash
#For example: Configure IP access address
export IP=<node external ip>
export PORT=<30000~32767 any port>
```

| Variable Name                    | Default Value                       | Required         | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------| ---------------------------- | ---              |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NAMESPACE               | zadig                        | No               | Kubernetes Namespace                                                                                      |
| IP                      |                              | Choose one of DOMAIN | Server IP address for accessing the Zadig system                                                                              |
| PORT                    |                              | Required if accessing via IP | Any valid Kubernetes port; the default K8S port range is 30000 - 32767                                                              |
| SERVICE_TYPE            | NodePort                     | No               | Service exposure method for the Zadig gateway; options: NodePort, LoadBalancer. Default: NodePort                                           |
| ENCRYPTION_KEY          |                              | No               | Generated by the installation process and used for data encryption and decryption. <font color=#FF000>**Please save it properly after the first installation**</font>. You need to set ENCRYPTION_KEY when reinstalling the system to ensure that previous data can be correctly decrypted |

## Step 3: Start the Installation

Execute the installation script:

```bash
# Server IP address for accessing the Zadig system
# If you have your own domain name, you can configure the domain name you can use export DOMAIN =<DOMAIN>
# If a port is already in use, try changing the port and retry
# all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh Replace with the actual downloaded script

export IP=<IP>
export PORT=< 30000 - 32767 any port>
./all_in_one_install_quickstart.sh
```

The installation process is expected to take about 30 minutes. The actual time may vary depending on hardware configuration and network conditions
When you see the output as shown in the figure, it means the installation has been completed.
## Step 4: Verify the Installation Results

You can check the service startup status using the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n zadig get po
```
## Step 5: Access the System

In the installation result output, you can find the system's access address.

## Zadig Uninstallation

You can use a script to uninstall the currently installed Zadig system with a single command. Just execute the uninstallation script:

```bash
#Modify the namespace according to the actual installation
export NAMESPACE=zadig
#Select the corresponding version of the uninstallation script based on the installed version
curl -SsL https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.0/uninstall.sh |bash
```
