This article primarily introduces how to use official scripts to install and upgrade Zadig on an existing Kubernetes cluster, suitable for enterprise production environments.


## Prepare Resources

- Kubernetes Cluster Version: <Badge text="v1.16" />~<Badge text="v1.30" /><br>
- Helm <Badge text="v3.5.0 +" /> Version<br>

::: tip Reminder
- If you need to use Zadig's built-in storage components (MySQL / MongoDB / MinIO), you must configure the Kubernetes `default` StorageClass before installation to support the creation of PVCs for data persistence
- Due to the configuration of some cluster network plugins, the backend Pods of a Service may not be able to access themselves through the Service. Ensure that this issue does not exist in the cluster before installation
- Configure the kube-dns service to support name-based addressing between services and Pods
:::

## Installation

### Step 1: Prepare the Installation Environment

- You need a machine that can connect to the cluster to execute the installation script.
- Ensure that the machine has the [kubectl client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed and can operate the cluster with administrative privileges.

### Step 2: Download the Installation Script

Depending on the usage scenario, choose different installation scripts. All scripts install the same version of Zadig, but they differ in whether they provide persistent storage capabilities.
|Scene |Download Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
|Quick Experience|Official Download Source: [https://download.koderover.com/install?type=quickstart](https://download.koderover.com/install?type=quickstart) <br> GitHub Source: [https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install_quickstart.sh](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install_quickstart.sh) | Does not provide persistent storage capabilities; not recommended for production use |
|Production Use|Official Download Source: [https://download.koderover.com/install?type=standard](https://download.koderover.com/install?type=standard) <br> GitHub Source: [https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install.sh](https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install.sh) | Provides persistent storage capabilities |

Download the installation script and add executable permissions. The following is an example using the GitHub source:

```bash
# Quick Experience:
curl -LO https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install_quickstart.sh
chmod +x ./install_quickstart.sh

# Production Use:
curl -LO https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/install.sh
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

::: tip Tips
The following table lists the environment variables supported by the installation script. The script will use default values during installation. If you need to configure these variables, set them as environment variables before running the installation script.
:::

```bash
# For example: Configure the IP access address
export IP=<Node External IP>
export PORT=< 30000 - 32767 Any Port>
# If a port is already in use, try another port
```

When reinstalling the system, you must set ENCRYPTION_KEY to ensure that the previous data can be correctly decrypted             |

### Step 3: Start the Installation

#### Quick Experience Installation
Execute the quick experience installation script

```bash
export IP=<IP>
# The external IP address of any node in the Kubernetes cluster, used to access the Zadig system
# If you have your own domain name, you can configure the domain name you can use export DOMAIN =<DOMAIN>
export PORT=<any valid Kubernetes port>
# If a port is already in use, try another port
./install_quickstart.sh
```
#### Production Use Installation

If you need production-level use, it is recommended to configure persistent data storage and then execute the production installation script.

- **Use external highly available MongoDB and MySQL**. The specific configuration is as follows.

::: warning
The version requirements for MongoDB and MySQL are as follows:
- MongoDB ≥ 4.4
- MySQL ≥ 5.7
:::

```bash
export IP=<IP>
export PORT=<any valid Kubernetes port>
export EMAIL=example@koderover.com
export PASSWORD=zadig
# Configure a highly available MySQL.
# Before installation, you need to manually create a database named dex and user in this MySQL instance
export MYSQL_HOST=<MYSQL_HOST>
export MYSQL_PORT=<MYSQL_PORT>
export MYSQL_USERNAME=<MYSQL_USERNAME>
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
# Configure a highly available MongoDB
export MONGO_URI=<MONGO_URI>
export MONGO_DB=<MONGO_DB>

./install.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify the Installation Results

![Expected Installation Results](../../../_images/k8s_install_success.png)

The installation process is expected to take about 10 minutes. The actual time may vary depending on the hardware configuration and network conditions
When you see the output as shown in the figure, it means the installation is complete. You can check the service startup status using the command.

```bash
kubectl -n zadig get po
```
### Step 5: Access the System

In the installation result output, you can obtain the system access address.

## Upgrade

Use the Helm command to upgrade, refer to [the documentation](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/install/helm-deploy/#%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7) for the upgrade process.

## Uninstall

You can use a script to uninstall the currently installed Zadig system in one click. Simply execute the uninstall script:

```bash
#Modify according to the actual installed namespace
export NAMESPACE=zadig
#Select the corresponding version of the uninstall script based on the actual installed version
curl -SsL https://github.com/koderover/zadig/releases/download/v3.4.1/uninstall.sh |bash
```

Official Uninstall Script:

```bash
curl -SsL https://download.koderover.com/install?type=uninstall | bash
