This article introduces the configuration and recommendations related to Zadig's high availability.

## High Availability Guarantee

Includes high availability for K8s infrastructure, Zadig system components, and databases.

### High Availability of K8s Resources

The high availability of basic resources is guaranteed by the provider of Kubernetes cluster (public cloud/self-built cloud).

### High Availability of Applications

The following recommendations are provided to ensure the high availability of applications:

- Use K8s native deployments to ensure that services can be quickly restarted if they exit abnormally
- Through the built-in metric interface, combined with Prometheus and pre-configured Grafana dashboards, monitor the performance metrics (CPU/Memory utilization) of Zadig components in real-time
- According to the business scale, configure appropriate resource specifications for each component, refer to the `microservice.{service}.resources` configuration item in the values.yaml file of Zadig Chart
- Combine Prometheus Alertmanager to configure monitoring and alerts for core components, recommended alert rules:
  - aslan, cron, hub-server components: trigger an alarm when the CPU or memory usage reaches 70% of the resource configuration upper limit and lasts for more than 2 minutes
  - dind component: An alarm is triggered when the CPU or memory usage reaches 80% of the resource configuration limit and lasts for more than 2 minutes
- Backup the current installation parameters and Chart:
  - Get the current installation parameters through `helm get values <Zadig Release Name> -n <Zadig Namespace> > Zadig.yaml`
  - Backup the current Chart through `helm pull koderover-chart/zadig --version=<version>`
- Configure multiple replicas for the application and adjust the number of component replicas based on business usage and resource consumption:

  **aslan:** You need to prepare a `ReadWriteMany` type StorageClass or PVC. Specify in Helm Values:
  ```yaml
  microservice.aslan.replicas: <replicas>
  microservice.aslan.storageClass: <storageClassName>

  or
  
  microservice.aslan.replicas: <replicas>
  microservice.aslan.existingClaim: <pvcName>
  ```

  **zadig-portal:** Specify in Helm Values:
  ```yaml
  frontend.replicas: <replicas>
  ```

  **user:** Specify in Helm Values:
  ```yaml
  microservice.user.replicas: <replicas>
  ```

  **hubserver:** Specify in Helm Values:
  ```yaml
  microservice.hubServer.replicas: <replicas>
  ```

  **dind:** Reference [Dind Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/pages/cluster_manage/#dind-%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE)

### High Data Availability

It is recommended to use highly available MongoDB and MySQL storage media during installation and to back up Zadig system data regularly:

- Using highly available databases, taking Alibaba Cloud as an example:
    - MySQL is recommended to use RDS MySQL High Availability Edition
    - MongoDB should use dedicated instances
- Use highly available artifact repositories:
  - Use highly available image repositories/Helm repositories provided by cloud vendors
  - If using a K8s Helm Chart project, it is recommended to integrate highly available object storage and set it as the default, data backup is recommended: once a day
- Regularly back up database data:
  - If using a public cloud, you need to manually set up the automatic backup policy for the public cloud's MySQL/MongoDB instances
  - Backup strategy recommendation: once a day
  - MinIO backup strategy: once a day
