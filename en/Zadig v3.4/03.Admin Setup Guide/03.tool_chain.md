## Overview
The Zadig platform boasts extensive openness and extensibility, supporting integration with almost all toolchains. It features deep integration with mainstream tools and platforms on the market and offers a user-friendly developer interface. Additionally, Zadig provides secondary development capabilities to facilitate efficient integration with enterprise-built systems. Through these features, Zadig helps enterprises transition from fragmented R&D management to platform engineering.

## Product Management Access
**Access Assessment**

Enterprises typically have existing CMDBs and portal centers to manage products and services. These can be linked to the enterprise's internal master data via OpenAPI. In Zadig, a project is the core business management unit, which can correspond to internal systems or independent products or sub-business lines. The "services" in Zadig can correspond to internal applications or micro-applications.
