Zadig supports many test scenarios, including performance, function, interface, UI, and end-to-end automation testing. It comes with built-in mainstream testing frameworks such as jMeter and ginkgo, and can also [install software packages](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/app/) to meet more diverse automation testing needs.

The testing module mainly includes management of automated test sets, support for testing environments, test execution, and result analysis. It also supports the output of standard Junit/Html test reports.

## Test Management

- `测试管理`: Cross-project test cases can be shared.
- `测试执行`: Supports CI/CD concurrent execution, individual execution, and cross-environment execution.
- `测试分析`: Analysis of single-scenario time consumption and pass rate, as well as cross-team testing benefits and health analysis.

## Test Configuration

### Test Execution Environment
Configure the environment in which the test task runs.

![Test Management](../../../../_images/add_test_310.png)

- `基础设施`: Supports executing test tasks on Kubernetes and hosts

- `操作系统` : Currently, the platform provides Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 20.04 for choice, and you can also customize the test execution environment. For details, please refer to: [Build Mirror Management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/custom-image/#%E6%AD%A5%E9%AA%A4-1-%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E9%95%9C%E5%83%8F) .
- `依赖的软件包`: Various tools needed during the compilation process, such as different versions of Java, Go, Govendor, Node, Bower, Yarn, Phantomjs, etc. The system currently includes common testing frameworks and tools such as Jmeter, Ginkgo, and Selenium.
::: tip
1. When selecting software packages, pay attention to the dependencies between multiple software packages and install them in the correct order. For example: Govendor depends on Go, so you must select Go first, then Govendor.
2. If there are other software packages or version requirements, the system administrator can configure the installation scripts in [Package Management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/app/).

|`PROJECT`|Project identifier|
|`TASK_URL`|The URL of the test workflow task|
|`CI`|The value is always true and can be used as needed|
|`Zadig`|The value is always true and can be used as needed|
|`REPONAME_<index>`|1. Get the name of the codebase at the specified `<index>`<br>2. `<index>` is the position of the code in the test configuration, with an initial value of 0<br>3. In the following example, using `$REPO_0` in the test script will get the name of the first codebase `Zadig`|
|`REPO_<index>`|1. Get the name of the codebase at the specified `<index>` and automatically replace the hyphen `-` in the name with an underscore `_`<br>2. `<index>` is the position of the code in the test configuration, with an initial value of 0<br>3. In the following example, using `$REPO_1` in the test script will get the converted name of the first codebase `test_resources`|
|`<REPO>_PR`|1. Get the Pull Request information for the specified `<REPO>` during the test process. Replace `<REPO>` with the specific codebase name when using it.<br>2. If the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the Pull Request information for the `test-resources` repository, use `$test_resources_PR` or `eval PR=\${${REPO_0}_PR}`<br>4. If multiple PRs are specified during the build, such as PR IDs 1, 2, 3, the value of the variable will be `1,2,3`<br>5. When the codebase is from the `其他` code source, this variable is not supported|
|`<REPO>_BRANCH`|1. Get the branch information for the specified `<REPO>` during the test process. Replace `<REPO>` with the specific codebase name when using it.<br>2. If the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3.

In the following example, to get the Commit ID information for the `test-resources` repository, use `$test_resources_COMMIT_ID` or `eval COMMIT_ID=\${${REPO_0}_COMMIT_ID}`<br>4. When the codebase is from the `其他` code source, this variable is not supported|
|`<REPO>_ORG`|1. Get the organization/user information for the specified `<REPO>` during the test process. Replace `<REPO>` with the specific codebase name when using it.<br>2. If the `<REPO>` information contains a hyphen `-`, replace `-` with an underscore `_`<br>3. In the following example, to get the organization/user information for the `test-resources` repository, use `$test_resources_ORG` or `eval ORG=\${${REPO_0}_ORG}`|

**Custom Test Variables**

Explanation:
- Supports string, single-choice, and multi-choice type variables.
- String-type variables can be set as sensitive information, such as Access Key Id, Secret Access Key, etc. After setting them as sensitive information, the plaintext will no longer be output in the test task's run log.

### Test Scripts
Declare the specific execution process of the test and use test variables in the test script.

### Test Report Configuration
Configure the directory or specific path to the test file where the test report is located.

![Test Management](../../../../_images/test_report.png)

Explanation:
  - Supports test reports in standard Junit XML/Html format.
  - For Junit test reports, configure the directory where they are located, such as `$WORKSPACE/path/to/junit_report/`. If there are multiple test reports in the directory, Zadig will merge all test reports into the final report.
  - For Html test reports, configure the specific file path, such as `$WORKSPACE/path/to/html_report/result.html`. The Html test report file will be included in the IM notification content sent by the test task.

### File Storage
In `添加步骤`, configure file storage to upload the specified file to the object store.

![Test Management](../../../../_images/export_test_files.png)

### Policy Configuration
- `超时时间`: Configure the timeout time for the test task execution. If the test task is not successful after the set time threshold, it will be considered a timeout failure.
- `缓存配置` : After the cache is enabled, the cache directory configured here will be used when the test task is executed. The directory configuration can use [test variables](#%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F) .

### Resource Configuration
- `集群选择`: Select the cluster resource used when the test task runs. The local cluster refers to the cluster where the Zadig system is located. For cluster integration, please refer to [Cluster Management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/pages/cluster_manage/).
- `操作系统规格` : Configure resource specifications for performing test tasks. The platform provides four configurations for high / Medium / Low / Lowest. In addition, you can also customize according to actual needs. If you need to use GPU resource, resource configuration form is `vendorname.com/gpu:num` , please refer to the document [scheduling for more information GPU](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/) .
- `调度策略` : Select the cluster scheduling policy, and the default is `随机调度` policy. Please refer to the document [to set the scheduling](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/pages/cluster_manage/#%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E8%B0%83%E5%BA%A6%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5) policy management.
- `使用宿主机 Docker daemon`: After enabling, use the Docker daemon on the node where the container is located during the test execution process to perform docker operations.

### Output Variables
Output environment variables in the test can realize variable transfer between different tasks in the workflow, and [pass variables](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/common-workflow/#%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F%E4%BC%A0%E9%80%92) in reference to the document.

### Webhook Trigger
Add trigger configuration to automatically trigger the specified event Webhook Please refer to the documentation for supported code sources: [code source information](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list) .

![Test Management](../../../../_images/test_webhook_config.png)

Parameter Description:
- `代码库`: The code repository that needs to listen to the trigger event.
- `目标分支`: The base branch when submitting a pull request. Regular expression configuration is supported; see [Regexp Syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax@go1.17.3#hdr-Syntax) for syntax.
- `触发事件`: Specify the Webhook event that triggers the test run. The optional events are as follows:
    - `Push commits` event (Merge operation) triggered.
    - `Pull requests` triggered when submitting a pull request.
    - `Push tags` triggered after creating a tag.
- `自动取消`: `Push commits` and `Pull requests` events support automatic cancellation. If you want to trigger only the latest commit, using this option will automatically cancel the preceding tasks in the queue.
- `文件目录` : By setting files and file directories, you can monitor files and directories, and trigger the test task when a file or directory changes (new / / delete). You can also ignore the corresponding file or directory changes and do not trigger the test task.
