### Basic Information

- `名称`: The name of the code scan, no duplication is allowed under the same project
- `扫描工具`: You can specify `SonarQube` or `其他`
- `基础设施`: Supports executing code scanning tasks on Kubernetes and hosts
- `扫描环境`: The specific runtime environment when executing the code scanning task
    - If you use the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, the system has a built-in environment `sonar` that supports this tool. Select `sonar`
    - If you use other tools for code scanning, you can refer to [自定义镜像](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/custom-image/) and add as needed
- `依赖的软件包`: When using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, you can configure this item to specify various software package tools needed during the scanning process, such as different versions of Java, Go, Node, etc
    - When selecting software packages, pay attention to the dependencies between multiple software packages and install them in the correct order. For example: Govendor depends on Go, so select Go first, then Govendor
    - The platform has some common software packages built-in. If you have other software packages or version requirements, the system administrator can configure the installation scripts in [软件包管理](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/app/)
- `Sonar 地址`: This item must be configured when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning
    - You need to integrate Sonar into the system in advance. Refer to the documentation: [Sonar 集成](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/sonar/)
    - When the code scanning is completed, Zadig will upload the results to the specified system


### Code Information
Configure code information for code scanning. When the code scanning is executed, the code will be pulled according to the specified configuration. For supported code sources, please refer to the document [code source information](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list) . For specific fields in the code information, please refer to the document [code information field description](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/build/#%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF) .

### Variables

Includes system-built-in variables and user-defined variables, which can be used directly in the scanning scripts.

### Scan Script
Configure the scan script as needed to scan the code.
![Pre-script configuration](../../../../_images/sonar_prescript_config.png)

### SonarScanner Scan

In `添加步骤`, you can configure SonarScanner Scan. `sonar.host.url` and `sonar.login` do not need to be configured, as the system will automatically inject them when performing a code scan. For more parameter configurations, refer to the [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/).

### Triggers and Notifications

#### Triggers

> Please refer to the supported code source: [Code source information](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list)

![Code scanning configuration](../../../../_images/scan_webhook_config_330.png)

Parameter Description:

- `代码库` : That is, the code library in [the code information](#%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF) configuration
- `目标分支`: The branch that listens to the code change event
- `触发事件`: Specify the Webhook event that triggers the code scan to run. The available events are as follows:
    - `Push commits` event (Merge operation) triggered
    - `Pull requests` Triggered when submitting a pull request
    - `Push tags` Triggered after creating a tag
- `自动取消`: If checked, when multiple Webhook events trigger code scanning tasks in sequence, the system will automatically cancel the task in the queue
- `文件目录` : When the specified file or directory changes (new / / delete), a code scan is triggered, using the following code repository file structure example:

``` bash
├── reponame  # 仓库名称
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── Makefile
  ├── README.md
  ├── src
    ├── service1/
    ├── service2/
    └── service3/
```
| Trigger Scenario | File Directory Configuration |
|----|------------|
| All file updates|`/`|
| All file updates except *.md|`/`<br>`!.md`|
| All file updates except those in the service1 directory | `/`<br>`!src/service1/`|
| All file updates in the service1 directory | `src/service1/` |
| File updates in the src directory (except those in the service1 directory)|`src`<br>`!src/service1/`|

#### Notification

Supports notifying the code scanning execution results to DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, Feishu Platform, email, and Webhook. For configuration, refer to the documentation [通知](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/workflow/im/).

## Quality Gate Check

> Supported when the scan tool is SonarQube.

In the advanced configuration, enable the quality gate check. After enabling, Zadig will obtain the quality gate rules from SonarQube. If the quality gate fails, the task status will be set to failed. It will also return the specific rules and rule judgment results

![Quality gate result](../../../../_images/sonar_gateway_result.png)

To set rules, go to the SonarQube system and modify or add the Quality Gate configuration.

![Quality gate modification](../../../../_images/sonar_config.png)

## Execute Code Scanning

Select the specific code scan -> Click `执行` to scan the code in the specified branch or tag.

![Execute code scanning](../../../../_images/run_scan_task.png)

When the code scanning task is completed, you can click the link to quickly jump to the SonarQube system to view the results.

> This feature is supported when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning.
