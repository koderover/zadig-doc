- Supports code scanning for all programming languages
- Supports using SonarQube and custom tools within Zadig for code scanning
- Supports configuring quality gate checks based on SonarQube scan results
- Supports one-click navigation to the Sonar system to analyze code scan results
- Supports code scanning for multiple code repositories
- Supports automatically triggering code scanning based on code changes
- Supports notifying the code scanning results to DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, and Feishu

## Create a New Code Scan

Visit the project -> Code Scanning, click `Create` and fill in the configuration.

### Basic Information

- `Name`: The name of the code scan, no duplication is allowed under the same project
- `Scannaer`: You can specify `SonarQube` or `其他`
- `Infrastructure`: Supports executing code scanning tasks on Kubernetes and hosts
- `Basic Image`: The specific runtime environment when executing the code scanning task
    - If you use the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, the system has a built-in environment `sonar` that supports this tool. Select `sonar`
    - If you use other tools for code scanning, you can refer to [Custom Image](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/custom-image/) and add as needed
- `Packages`: When using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning, you can configure this item to specify various software package tools needed during the scanning process, such as different versions of Java, Go, Node, etc
    - When selecting software packages, pay attention to the dependencies between multiple software packages and install them in the correct order. For example: Govendor depends on Go, so select Go first, then Govendor
    - The platform has some common software packages built-in. If you have other software packages or version requirements, the system administrator can configure the installation scripts in [Package Management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/app/)
- `Sonar Host`: This item must be configured when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning
    - You need to integrate Sonar into the system in advance. Refer to the documentation: [Sonar Integration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/sonar/)
    - When the code scanning is completed, Zadig will upload the results to the specified system


### Code Information
Configure code information for code scanning. When the code scanning is executed, the code will be pulled according to the specified configuration. For supported code sources, please refer to the document [code source information](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list) . For specific fields in the code information, please refer to the document [code information field description](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/build/#%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF) .

### Variables

Includes system-built-in variables and user-defined variables, which can be used directly in the scanning scripts.

### Scan Script
Configure the scan script as needed to scan the code.
![Pre-script configuration](../../../../_images/sonar_prescript_config.png)

### SonarScanner Scan

In `Add Steps`, you can configure SonarScanner Scan. `sonar.host.url` and `sonar.login` do not need to be configured, as the system will automatically inject them when performing a code scan. For more parameter configurations, refer to the [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/).

- `Report Export `: Configure the scan report path
- `Timeout`: If the scan does not complete within the set time threshold, it will be considered a timeout failure
- `Cache`: After enabling the cache, the cache directory configured here will be used when the code scan is executed
- `Cluster`: Select the cluster resource used when the code scan task runs. The local cluster refers to the cluster where the Zadig system is located. You can refer to [集群管理](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/pages/cluster_manage/) to integrate more cluster resources
- `Resources` : Configure resource specifications for executing code scanning tasks. The platform provides four configurations for high / Medium / Low / Lowest. In addition, you can also customize according to actual needs. If you need to use GPU resource, resource configuration form is `vendorname.com/gpu:num` , please refer to the document [scheduling for more information GPU](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/)
- `Scheduling` : Select the cluster scheduling policy, use `随机调度` policy by default. Please refer to the document [to set the scheduling policy](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/pages/cluster_manage/#%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E8%B0%83%E5%BA%A6%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5) management.
- `Output parameter` : Output the environment variables in the code scan, which can realize variable transfer between different tasks in the workflow, and [variable transfer](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/common-workflow/#%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F%E4%BC%A0%E9%80%92) in reference document
- `Hooks and Notifications` : Configure Webhook Event, automatically trigger code scanning task execution, configuration details reference: [triggers and notifications](#%E8%A7%A6%E5%8F%91%E5%99%A8%E4%B8%8E%E9%80%9A%E7%9F%A5)

### Triggers and Notifications

#### Triggers

> Please refer to the supported code source: [Code source information](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#function-compatibility-list)

![Code scanning configuration](../../../../_images/scan_webhook_config_330.png)

Parameter Description:

- `Repository` : That is, the code library in [the code information](#%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF) configuration
- `Target Branch`: The branch that listens to the code change event
- `Trigger Event`: Specify the Webhook event that triggers the code scan to run. The available events are as follows:
    - `Push commits` event (Merge operation) triggered
    - `Pull requests` Triggered when submitting a pull request
    - `Push tags` Triggered after creating a tag
- `Auto Cancel`: If checked, when multiple Webhook events trigger code scanning tasks in sequence, the system will automatically cancel the task in the queue
- `File Directory` : When the specified file or directory changes (new / / delete), a code scan is triggered, using the following code repository file structure example:

``` bash
├── reponame  # Repository name
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── Makefile
  ├── README.md
  ├── src
    ├── service1/
    ├── service2/
    └── service3/
```
| Trigger Scenario | File Directory Configuration |
|----|------------|
| All file updates|`/`|
| All file updates except *.md|`/`<br>`!.md`|
| All file updates except those in the service1 directory | `/`<br>`!src/service1/`|
| All file updates in the service1 directory | `src/service1/` |
| File updates in the src directory (except those in the service1 directory)|`src`<br>`!src/service1/`|

#### Notification

Supports notifying the code scanning execution results to DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, Feishu Platform, email, and Webhook. For configuration, refer to the documentation [Notification](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/workflow/im/).

## Quality Gate Check

> Supported when the scan tool is SonarQube.

In the advanced configuration, enable the quality gate check. After enabling, Zadig will obtain the quality gate rules from SonarQube. If the quality gate fails, the task status will be set to failed. It will also return the specific rules and rule judgment results

![Quality gate result](../../../../_images/sonar_gateway_result.png)

To set rules, go to the SonarQube system and modify or add the Quality Gate configuration.

![Quality gate modification](../../../../_images/sonar_config.png)

## Execute Code Scanning

Select the specific code scan -> Click `Run` to scan the code in the specified branch or tag.

![Execute code scanning](../../../../_images/run_scan_task.png)

When the code scanning task is completed, you can click the link to quickly jump to the SonarQube system to view the results.

> This feature is supported when using the `SonarQube` tool for code scanning.
