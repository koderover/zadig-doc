Zadig supports flexible permission configuration to enable team members to collaborate securely and efficiently, including:

- System Role: System-level permission configuration, details: [System Role](#system-roles)
- Permission configuration: Project-level permission configuration, details: [Permission configuration](#permission-configuration)
- Project access permissions: define the public / Private properties of the project, details: [Project access permissions](#project-access-permissions)
- Collaboration mode: The permission configuration for specified workflow and environmental resource granularity within the project, details: [Collaboration mode](#collaboration-mode)

## System Roles

::: tip
Only system administrators can configure system roles.
:::

Click on the avatar in the upper right corner > User Management > System Role to configure.

![Permission Management](../../_images/system_role_330.png)

System roles can be specified in user information.

## Project Access Permissions
::: tip
Only system administrators and project administrators can configure project access permissions.
:::
Click Configure > Modify > Edit Access Permissions to set the public/private attributes of the project. The differences between public and private projects are as follows:
- For private projects, all users have no permissions by default.
- For public projects, all users have read-only permissions by default, allowing them to view the environment, workflow, services, build, test, version, and code scanning in the project.

## Permission Configuration
::: tip
Only project administrators can configure this.
:::

> Define project members and their permissions for all environments, workflows, services, testing, version management, code scanning, and other resources in the project.

In the project details page, click `Configuration` -> `Permission` to configure project members and their permissions.

![Project Permission Configuration](../../_images/project_permission_config.png)

### Member Management

In `Member Management`, view the user member list and corresponding roles of the project, and configure user roles as needed.

- Roles are a collection of permissions, in [role management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/permission/#role-management) , you can view permission details in roles
- Support adding user groups to project members to implement permission configuration for batch users

![View Project Member List](../../_images/project_member_list.png)

### Role Management
Includes system-built-in roles and project administrator-defined roles.

#### Built-in Roles
- `project-admin`: Project administrator, can operate all resources in the project under their jurisdiction and can modify the project configuration.
- `read-project-only`: Members with this role can see the corresponding project in the project list but have no permission to operate the resources in the project.
- `read-only`: Read-only role. In public projects, all users have this role by default. The corresponding permission items are as follows:

![View read-only Permissions](../../_images/read_only_permission.png)

#### Custom Roles

In `Role Management`, you can customize roles and assign permissions.

### Permission List

Describes the correspondence between each permission item and function. For the complete functional documents in each functional module, refer to: [Workflow](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/common-workflow/) / [Environment](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/env/k8s) / [Service](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/service/k8s/) / [Build](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/build/) / [Test](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/test/) / [Version Management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/version/) / [Code Scan](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/scan/).

::: tip
The version in the K8s YAML project is created by executing the delivery deployment workflow. If permissions for creating a new version are required, configure the workflow execution permissions.

## Collaboration Mode
::: tip
Only project administrators can configure this.
:::

Applicable to projects with access permissions set to `Private`. It allows for permission control over specified workflows and environment resources within the project.

### Configure Collaboration Mode
Switch to `Collaboration Mode` in project permission management to configure the functional modules and permissions used by each member during the collaboration process.

![Collaboration Mode Management](../../_images/collaboration_mode_config.png)

Configuration instructions:

- Fill in the name of the collaboration mode, such as `developer`.
- Select participating members, only project members can be selected. If the users who need to be added are not in the member list, they can be added in [member management](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/permission/#member-management) .
- Configure collaboration rules. Based on the needs, configure workflows and environmental resources for collaboration members and set operation permissions and recycling rules, including:
    - Exclusive: Based on the benchmark workflow/benchmark environment, create a new workflow/environment for each collaborative member for their exclusive use. The naming rule for the new resource is `Collaboration Mode Name-Benchmark Resource Name-User Source-User Name`, applicable to K8s YAML/K8s Helm Chart projects
    - Shared: Collaboration members share the use of the benchmark workflow/benchmark environment resources without creating new resources for them.
    - Resource Recycling Policy: If a member does not access the project within the configured time, the member's resources will be recycled. When the member revisits the project, they will regain the resources.

### How to Use It in Collaboration
When a member in the collaboration mode logs into the Zadig system and enters the specified project, they should confirm the workflows and environmental resources allocated in the collaboration mode.

![Collaboration Mode Management](../../_images/collaboration_mode_config_2.png)

Wait a moment for the system to prepare the resources, and the member can then obtain the operation permissions for the corresponding resources and use them in their daily work.
