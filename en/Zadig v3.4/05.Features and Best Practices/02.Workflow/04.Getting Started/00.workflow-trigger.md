This article primarily introduces the triggering of Zadig workflows, including:
- Manual Trigger
- Trigger-based triggers, supporting the following five types of triggers:
    - `Git`: The workflow is automatically triggered after code changes
    - `Timer`: The workflow is triggered at a set time
    - `JIRA`: The workflow is automatically triggered after a JIRA issue status changes
    - `Feishu Project Trigger`: The workflow is automatically triggered after a Feishu project status changes
    - `Universal`: A third-party system triggers the workflow via Webhook
- Calling the Developer OpenAPI to Trigger

## Manual Trigger

### Workflow Execution

Click "Execute Workflow" to modify the value of the workflow variables and select the tasks to be executed as needed:
> If the value of the workflow variable is set to a fixed value, the variable will not be visible on the page when the workflow is executed.

![run_common_workflow](../../../../_images/run_common_workflow_1_220.png)

Click on a specific build task to view the build log:
> The task name format is: `Service Name-Service Component Name-Task Name`

![run_common_workflow](../../../../_images/run_common_workflow_2.png)

After a workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. When retried, it will start from the failed task, and the previously successful tasks will not be executed again.

### Execution Parameters

![Workflow Details Page](../../../../_images/workflow_trigger_6.png)

Explanation:

- `Area 1`: Select the task to be executed
- `Area 2`: Enter different execution parameters based on the selected task

## Git Trigger

After configuring the Git trigger, the workflow can be automatically triggered when the code that meets the configuration conditions changes.

::: warning
When the code source is of type `Other`, the Git trigger is not supported.
:::

### How to Configure

The code hosting platform triggers the Zadig workflow via Webhook, so you need to configure the corresponding Webhook in the corresponding repository. Zadig provides two ways to configure the Webhook:
- Automatic Creation: Just configure the trigger parameters in the workflow. Zadig will automatically create a Webhook in the corresponding code repository, suitable for scenarios where the code source integration account has permission to create a Webhook in the code repository.
- Manual Creation: First configure the Webhook in the code repository, then configure the trigger parameters in Zadig. This is suitable for scenarios where the code source integration account does not have permission to create a Webhook in the code repository.

##### Automatic Creation

Click `Triggers` on the right side of the workflow.

![Workflow Triggers](../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook.png)

Select `Git Trigger` -> Fill in the parameters and save.

<img src="../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook_0.png" width="325">
<img src="../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook_1.png" width="450">

Parameter Description:
- `Workflow Execution Variables`: The tasks you want to be triggered and their specific configurations
- Other parameters: Please refer to the description in [Git basic configuration of the trigger](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/common-workflow/#git-trigger)

##### Manual Creation

If the code source integration account in the system integration does not have permission to create a Webhook in the code repository, you can choose to use manual creation to configure it. The steps are as follows:

1. Click `Manual Webhook Creation` to switch to the manual creation page.

<img src="../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook_2.png" width="465">
<img src="../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook_3.png" width="310">

2. Access the code repository to configure the Webhook, fill in the Webhook URL, Secret Token, and trigger events. The example for GitLab is as follows:

::: tip Trigger events that need to be configured for different code sources
- GitHub code source: Branch or tag creation, Check runs, Pull requests, Pushes
- GitLab code source: Push events, Tag push events, Merge request events
- Gitee code source: Push, Tag Push, Pull Request
:::

![Workflow Triggers](../../../../_images/common_workflow_config_webhook_4.png)

3. Refer to [Git The basic configuration of the trigger](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/common-workflow/#git-trigger) is filled in the relevant configuration in Zadig and then saved.


### Code Change Trigger Effect

After the configuration is completed, the workflow can be triggered by submitting a pull request, merge request, or push according to the configuration. Taking GitLab as an example, the workflow feedback information can be viewed in the merge request, as shown below.

<!-- ### 进阶场景：Pull Request 独立测试环境

::: tip
1. 通过工作流触发器中配置基准环境和环境销毁策略实现 pull request 独立测试环境的持续交付过程，完成一段代码的全生命周期质量验证。
2. 支持的代码源请参考：[代码源信息](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/settings/codehost/overview/#功能兼容列表)。
:::

Pull request 级持续交付分为以下步骤：
- 提交更新的 pull request 代码
- 根据选择的基准环境生成一个相同服务版本的临时环境
- 执行工作流更新该测试环境中的服务版本，以及针对该集成环境进行相关自动化测试验证
- 根据环境销毁策略对测试环境进行回收操作

具体配置如下图所示：

![workflow](../../../../_images/workflow_trigger_4.png)

提交代码变更，在对应 pull request 下可看到关于独立环境的状态信息：

![workflow](../../../../_images/webhook_status_on_gitlab.png)

创建的独立环境效果如下：
