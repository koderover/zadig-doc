This article explains how to configure and use packages on the Zadig system. When running builds, tests, code scans, and general tasks in Zadig, users typically need to install the necessary software package environment based on their specific business requirements to build or compile. For example, compiling backend-related code requires a Go environment, Java environment, etc., while front-end code requires a NodeJS environment and other environments.

## Create a New Software Package

Click `System Settings` -> `Package Management` -> Click `Add`.

Parameter Description:
- `Name`: The name of the package
- `Version`: The version of the package
- `Bin Path`: The binary installation path of the software package. The default is `$HOME/软件包名`
- `Enabled`: Controls whether the package is displayed in the package list. Packages currently in use are not affected. Enabled packages can be displayed in `Project` -> `Build` -> `Add` Build -> `Dependent Software Packages`
- `Package Address`: The system automatically downloads the installation package from the configured address and caches it. The installation package can be obtained through the `${FILEPATH}` variable
- `Installation Script`: The installation `shell` script for the software package

## Using Software Packages

Supports configuring dependent software packages for builds, tests, code scans, and general tasks. Refer to the following documentation:

- [Build Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/build/)
- [Test Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/test/#test-configuration)
- [Code Scan Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/scan/)
- [General Task Configuration](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/project/workflow-jobs/#general-tasks)
