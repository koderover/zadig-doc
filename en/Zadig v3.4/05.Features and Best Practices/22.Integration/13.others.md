This article describes the integration of other external systems in the Zadig system. Main application scenarios:
1. In the `Version Delivery` -> `Create Version` module, after configuring the Hook, the external system can receive information about the completion of Helm Chart version delivery.
2. In the `Data View` -> `Performance Insights` module, after configuring the metrics, data can be collected from the external system.

To access Zadig, click `System Settings` -> `Integration` -> `Other Systems` to add relevant information about the external system, as shown in the figure below.
