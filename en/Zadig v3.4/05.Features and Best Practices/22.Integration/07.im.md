This article introduces the integration of IM applications on the Zadig system, utilizing the capabilities of IM applications to achieve notifications and approvals. Currently, it supports the integration of Feishu, DingTalk, and Enterprise WeChat applications.

## Feishu

> The "Manual Approval" and "Notification" tasks in workflows are used.

Follow the steps below to configure Feishu notifications and approvals:
1. Create and publish an application on the Feishu Developer Platform
2. Configure the application credentials in the Zadig system to obtain the `Request Address` for the application to push event messages
3. Configure the `Request Address` on the Feishu Developer Platform

### Step 1: Create a Feishu App
1. Visit [the Feishu Developer Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/), and create an "enterprise self-built application" as shown in the figure below.

2. In `Permission Management` - `Data Permission`, set the address book permission scope, and in `API Permission`, enable the permissions required for the approval application, as shown in the figure below.

> Zadig's workflow supports configuring Feishu approvals, and the available approvers are related to the address book scope specified here.

The required permissions for **approval** are as follows:
