This article primarily introduces how to leverage Zadig's K8s YAML project service management variable configuration capabilities to achieve isolation of multiple environments and global configuration management through a single set of configurations

- Database Isolation: Each environment's business data is stored independently in different databases, ensuring no interference between them
- Differentiated Domain Name Access: Use different domain names to access different environments
- Differentiated Business Configuration: Business configurations are managed in configuration centers such as Nacos and Apollo, with different environments using different configurations
- Global Management of Shared Configurations: Globally manage configurations shared by multiple services

Zadig provides both system-built-in variables and custom variables to distinguish different variable values across different environments. The following sections detail the practical application of these configurations within the Zadig system.

## Database Isolation

> Applicable: Business data in different environments are isolated from each other, with one database corresponding to multiple connection addresses or connecting to different databases.

### Configure Service Variables

As shown in the `vote` service, the database-related configurations are managed in a ConfigMap and mounted to the application via a volume. In Zadig, the database configuration items are extracted into custom variables `mgo_addr` and `mgo_db`, and default values are set for them.
- `mgo_addr` default value setting: `220.16.0.43`, which can be configured according to actual conditions.
- The default value for `mgo_db` is set to `$Product$_$EnvName$_vote`. Here, we use the system-built-in global variables `$Product$` and `$EnvName$`, which represent the project name and environment name, respectively.

### Use Service Variables

When creating a new environment, the variables in the configuration can use the default values or be re-specified.

When the environment is created, the variables are automatically rendered, as shown in the figure below. In the dev environment, it is rendered as `vote-dev-vote`, and in the qa environment, it is rendered as `vote-qa-vote`.

## Differentiated Domain Name Access

> Applicable: Create multiple environments in Zadig and use different domain names to access different environments

### Configure a Wildcard Domain

Configure a wildcard domain for the cluster entry, such as `*.koderover.com`, ensuring the domain name DNS correctly resolves to the external IP of the cluster [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) LoadBalancer.

![Differentiated Domain Names](../../../../_images/multi_env_yaml_domain_0.png)

### Configure and Use Service Variables

In this example, the external network access address for the service entry point is configured. In Zadig, a global variable <span v-pre>{{.domain}}</span> is set, with the variable value configured as `vote-$EnvName$.koderover.com`

![Differentiated Domain Names](../../../../_images/multi_env_yaml_domain_1.png)

When creating a new environment, the system automatically renders the variables, as shown in the following diagram:

## Differentiated Business Configuration

> Applicable: The service's business configuration is managed in a third-party configuration center (such as Nacos, Apollo, etc.), with different environments using different configuration items. The following example uses an Apollo configuration center to manage and use business configurations in different environments through Zadig.

### Configure Service Variables

Taking the `myapp` service as an example, we need to set the correspondence between the Apollo configuration parameters and the Zadig environment variables in Zadig.

Configuration items defined in Zadig (can be set according to the situation):
- `APOLLO_APP_NAMESPACE`: Apollo Configuration Center namespace (Namespace), assigned using the Zadig custom variable `apollo_app_namespace`, with the default value set to `zadig.dev`
- `APOLLO_APP_ID`: The Apollo Configuration Center application (Application) is assigned a value using the Zadig system-built-in variable `$Service$`.
- `APOLLO_APP_ENV`: Apollo Configuration Center environment (Environment), assigned using the Zadig system built-in variable `$EnvName$`.
- `APOLLO_APP_CLUSTER`: Apollo Configuration Center cluster (Cluster), assigned using the Zadig custom variable `apollo_app_cluster`, with the default value set to `local`.

![Differentiated Business Configuration](../../../../_images/multi_env_yaml_config_0.png)

### Use Service Variables

When the environment is launched or the `myapp` service starts, the service configuration is retrieved from the corresponding configuration center.

## Global Management of Shared Configurations

In practical application scenarios, multiple services often share the same database address, configuration management system address, and other information. To effectively manage these shared configuration items and simplify subsequent maintenance, we can use "global variables" to uniformly store and manage these variables. This way, when configuration updates or changes are needed, a single modification in the global variable can achieve synchronized updates for all related services, improving management efficiency and reducing the possibility of errors.


### Configure Global Variables

Define global variables by extracting some variables from service variables as global variables.

### Using Global Variables

When creating a new environment, you can choose whether the service uses global variables

![Global Variables](../../../../_images/multi_env_yaml_global_2.png)

The values of global variables in the environment can be modified. Once the global variables change, all services that depend on these variables will be automatically updated to ensure consistency and real-time configuration.
