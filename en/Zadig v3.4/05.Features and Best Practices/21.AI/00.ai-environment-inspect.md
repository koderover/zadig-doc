Faced with the complex Kubernetes production environment, traditional manual inspections are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and often fail to cover potential risks. Zadigâ€™s AI environment inspection feature ensures environmental stability through scheduled inspections and intelligent alerts.

Scenario Value:
- No need for manual inspections; AI automatically completes environmental health checks, significantly reducing labor costs.
- With instant alerts, teams can quickly respond to environmental issues, preventing minor problems from escalating into major failures.

## Automatic Inspection on Schedule

AI regularly conducts comprehensive inspections of the Kubernetes environment, covering key indicators such as resource status and service health.
