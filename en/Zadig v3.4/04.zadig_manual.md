Software delivery is a complex and challenging process involving multiple elements such as people, technology, processes, and tools. During this process, enterprises often encounter the following issues: difficulty in simulating development environments, challenges in multi-business joint debugging, and low R&D efficiency; low efficiency in manual testing, unstable environments, and difficulties in automation; heavy operations and maintenance burdens, numerous tools, and low delivery efficiency; communication difficulties across departments and time-consuming process formulation... To address these challenges, Zadig enhances organizational efficiency through platform engineering and technology upgrades, establishing a comprehensive integrated engineering collaboration baseline, helping enterprises deliver software more efficiently and unleash team productivity.

## Zadig Production and Research Collaboration Solution

Zadig provides an engineering foundation, enabling the production and research teams to collaborate uniformly and achieve agile delivery, completing the entire lifecycle of requirements from development to testing to release. It also supports custom processes, tool expansion, and the orchestration of test services, IT services, security services, and other capabilities. Through Zadig, everything can be automated, allowing engineers to focus on innovation.

## Introduction to Core Scenarios

Development, testing, operation and maintenance engineers are based on the Zadig unified collaboration plane and deliver using automated workflows and cloud-native environments. In addition, the business person in charge/enterprise management personnel can analyze the overall operation of the project in the performance board and analyze the performance shortcomings in each process of the project. The following is an introduction to different characters.

### Administrator Preparation

Administrators (such as operations engineers) configure the engineering foundation required for daily team collaboration in Zadig, including environments and workflows needed for different roles in R&D, testing, and operations.

**Workflow Example**

### Development Engineer

#### Local Self-Testing

IDE hot deployment, where code written locally is hot-deployed to a remote environment. For more details, refer to: [VSCode Plugin Usage Guide](/en/Zadig%20v3.4/zadig-toolkit/overview/).

![Product User Manual](../_images/vscode_demo.png)

#### Submit Code and CI Process

1. After writing code locally, submit code changes via PR/MR (Pull Request/Merge Request)
	- Create a new branch locally based on the develop branch and write code on the new branch
	- After completing the code, push it to the code repository under your account
	- Create a code change PR/MR
2. Automatically trigger the CI process, including unit testing, code style checking, and code scanning
3. After the CI process is complete, receive feedback on the PR/MR

#### Self-Testing by a Single Engineer

Manually or automatically trigger the dev workflow, which includes steps: Build > Deploy dev environment > Smoke test > IM notification.
